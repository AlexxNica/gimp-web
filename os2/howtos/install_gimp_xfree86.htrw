<h1>How To Install GIMP For OS2/xfree86</h1>

<h2>1. Requirements</h2>
<p>
  <a href="home:gimp">The GIMP</a> is a software package that has been ported from Un*x. 
  It also uses the <a href="home:gtk">GIMP toolkit (GTK)</a> for its graphical user 
  interface. As a result, it requires <a href="http:Package-emx-os2">emx 0.9d fix 3</a> 
  or later and <a href="http:Package-xfree86-os2">XFree86/OS2</a> (or another X server 
  like Exceed or HOBLink X11) to run. The <a href="home:People-Hennecke_Christian">author's site</a> also 
  contains a extensive installation guides for <a href="os2-howto:Installing_XFree86/OS2_3.3.x-Hennecke_Christian">XFree86/OS2 3.3.x</a> 
  and <a href="os2-howto:Installing_XFree86/OS2_4.3.0-Hennecke_Christian">XFree86/OS2 4.x</a>, 
  as for EMX please refer to the included, well-written installation manual. For 
  XFree86/OS2 an accelerated X server that is capable of 16 bit to 32 bit color 
  depths is highly recommened. Note that the XSVGA server does contain excellent 
  acceleration support for some cards, e.g. Matrox ones. If you want to make use 
  of True Type fonts XFree86/OS2 3.3.x, you will need to run a 
  <a href="wgo:os2-howtos_install_fonts_xfree86">special font server</a> 
  or use the <a href="plugin-home:gimpfreetype-stable">GIMP Freetype plug-in</a>.
</p>
<p>
  GIMP runs on Warp 3 with Fixpak 17 or later, Warp 4 with Fixpak 5 or later and 
  WSeB. You will also need quite a lot of RAM, as always if you want to do serious 
  image processing. Try 64MB for a start.
</p>
<p>
  The GIMP distribution comes in several archives that can be obtained from 
  <a href="http:Package-GIMP-os2-stable-xfree86">www.os2ports.com</a>. You will 
  also need several basic libraries for GIMP to work, which you can also download 
  from there. (In case you wonder why: These are libraries that are installed by 
  default on most Linux systems, so it's only natural to use them.) The GIMP 
  Freetype plug-in is available from the <a href="plugin-home:gimpfreetype-os2-stable">files section of the GIMP/OS2 
  mailing list at <a href="maillist:GIMP-os2-url">Yahoogroups: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gimp-os2</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The version number mentioned below were the latest available at the point of the release of The GIMP 1.2.1. Don't 
  hesitate to download archives with higher numbering.

</ul>
<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>
  In the following it is assumed that you have emx and XFree86/OS2 correctly 
  set up. Installation is pretty straightforward.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check your CONFIG.SYS file for a SET EMXOPT statement. Make sure there is one 
      that says at least:
      <pre class="code">
SET EMXOPT=-h1024 
      </pre>
      Note that the parameter is case-sensitive!</li>
  <li>If you have used a version of GIMP that is older than 1.2.0, delete the 
      \XFree86\lib\X11\.gimp-1.1 tree or the corresponding one for the 1.0.2 
      version first.</li>
  <li>Create a temporary directory and place all GIMP packages and libraries you want to install therein.</li>
  <li>Open an OS/2 command line window and change to the above mentioned temporary directory.</li>
  <li>Unpack all archives to your X11ROOT path. That's the directory in which the 
      XFree86 directory resides, usually the root of the drive. If XFree86 is 
      installed in e.g. E:\XFree86, enter:
      <pre class="code">
unzip *zip -d e:\ 
      </pre>
      <em class="warn">WARNING:</em> If you don't use the DLL-only library archives 
      from birdy.os2.ru, chances are that those archives' directories start below 
      the \XFree86 directory. In this case place those files in another temporary 
      directory and enter the following to unpack them:
      <pre class="code">
unzip *zip -d e:\XFree86 
      </pre></li>
  <li>Unpack the compression software bzip2 or gzip to a temporary directory and place 
      the executables in your PATH.</li>
  <li>To enable the Freetype plug-in, decrompress it with
      <pre class="code">
bzip2 -d gimp-freetype.exe.bz 
      </pre>
      and copy the resulting executable to the 
      \XFree86\lib\X11\.gimp-1.2\plug-ins directory.</li>
  <li>To install SANE, follow the README in that package. Well, in fact installing 
      SANE is a !%&amp;*# mess and worth a lengthy HowTo itself. You need to add an 
      entry to your CONFIG.SYS that points to a directory .sane in your HOME 
      directory, e.g.
      <pre class="code">
SET SANE_CONFIG_DIR=e:\home\os2user\.sane 
      </pre>
      The library LIBSANE.DLL needs to be in your PATH for xscanimage to find it and 
      it needs a configuration file DLL.CONF in the configuration directory mentioned 
      above that depending on your scanner must (or doesn't need to) explicitely point 
      to its address, i.e. b1t6l0 if the scanner is on bus 1, has SCSI-ID 6 and LUN 0.
      If you need further help, try the mailing list at Yahoogroups: 
      <a href="maillist:SANE-os2-url">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sane-os2</a>.</li>
  <li><em class="warn">CAUTION:</em> Unfortunately, the plug-in archives are not 
      updated with every new release of The GIMP. The problem is that they require the 
      presence of certain GIMP DLLs whose names change with every new GIMP release! 
      So if you install The GIMP 1.2.1, but you (have to) use the plug-in package gimpe120,
      the plug-ins included won't work unless you had installed the corresponding 
      previous version of GIMP and you haven't deleted its DLLs yet. If this is not 
      the case, you will have to get the old DLLs from somewhere, e.g. an old gimpd 
      archive, which is very large unfortunately. Visit Team OS/2 Region Trier's GIMP 
      archive at <a href="plugin-archive:os2">http://cip.uni-trier.de/thielen/teamos2/gimp_a/.</a><br />
      To find out which DLL is missing, change to the E:\XFree86\lib\X11\.gimp-1.2\plug-ins 
      directory and start the offending plug-in from the command-line. You should see 
      a message of the following kind:
      <pre class="code">
SYS1804: File GIMP1130 not found. 
      </pre>
      So the missing file is GIMP1130.DLL. If the plug-in should require additional 
      missing DLLs, you will have to repeat this step after having made available the 
      previously missed DLL. You can save a lot of time by using the tool "ldd" that 
      is capable of finding out all DLLs a program requires and of detecting if they 
      can be loaded correctly.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Congratulations, you have finished your part of the GIMP installation. Now 
  start XFree86/OS2, open a shell terminal and type: <kbd>gimp121</kbd> 
  Now GIMP should start up and initialize. It's a good idea to copy or rename 
  gimp121.exe to gimp.exe, so other programs can find it. Just make sure you 
  don't forget to repeat this for the next version you install!
</p>
<h2>3. Using GTK themes</h2>
<p>
  Like other GTK applications GIMP is capable of using GTK themes. However, there 
  are some differences. By default, GIMP only uses some of the elements of themes. 
  Certain images, for instance, are usually ignored. This can be quite useful, 
  since some themes can make GIMP's icons unreadable. To make GIMP use GTK themes 
  like any other GTK app, shut it down, copy your .gtkrc file from your HOME 
  directory to \XFree86\lib\X11\.gimp-1.2 and rename it as gtkrc (note the 
  missing dot?). Now fire up GIMP and see what has changed.
</p>
<p>
  <em class="warn">WARNING:</em> Themes are very demanding of your hardware. Be sure to have at least 
  128MB RAM if you want to use them and still be able to edit some larger images. 
  Moreover, due to the client-server architecture of XFree86, themes create a lot 
  of additional network traffic. This will result in extremely prolonged startup 
  times and slow operation through the bank if you use HOBLink X11 or Exceed as X 
  server on your local machine, or you run GIMP on a remote machine.
</p>
<h2>4. Getting help</h2>
<p>
  If it still doesn't work, you think that you've discovered a bug, or you just 
  want to say thankyou to the people who ported the package there is a mailing 
  list for GIMP on OS/2 at Yahoogroups: <a href="maillist:GIMP-os2-url">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gimp-os2</a>.
