<p><i>The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is
used to edit and manipulate images. It can load and save a
variety of image formats and can be used to convert between
formats. GIMP can also be used as a paint program. It
features a set of drawing and painting tools such as
airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint brush. Painting and
drawing tools can be applied to an image with a variety of
paint modes. It also offers an extensive array of selection
tools like rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color. GIMP offers a
variety of plugins that perform a variety of image
manipulations. Examples include bumpmap, edge detect,
gaussian blur, and many others. In addition, GIMP has
several scripting extension which allow for advanced
non-interactive processing and creation of images.</i></p>

<p><i>The gimp accepts the following options: Display a
list of all commandline options. Output the version info.
Show startup messages. Do not use shared memory between GIMP
and its plugins. Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will
send the data via pipe. This will result in slower
performance than using shared memory. Do not use CPU
accelerations such as MMX or SSE even if GIMP detects that
your CPU provides this functionality. Do not load patterns,
gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful in
non-interactive situations where startup time is to be
minimized. Do not load any fonts. No text functionality will
be available if this option is used. Run without a user
interface. Use the designated X display. Do not show the
splash screen. Use a different sessionrc for this GIMP
session. The given session name is appended to the default
sessionrc filename. Use an alternative gimprc instead of the
default one. Useful in cases where plugins paths or machine
specs may be different. Use an alternate system gimprc file.
Output a gimprc file with default settings. Enable debugging
signal handlers. Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or
warnings. Print the messages on the console instead. If a
stack-trace should be generated in case of fatal signals. If
the PDB should provide aliases for deprecated functions.
Execute the set of &lt;commands&gt; non-interactively. The
set of &lt;commands&gt; is typically in the form of a script
that can be executed by one of the GIMP scripting
extensions. When &lt;commands&gt; is</i> <b>-</b> <i>the
commands are read from standard input.</i></p>

<p><i>to get the default host and display number. to get
the name of a resource file that overrides the global
resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</i></p>

<p><i>GIMP&rsquo;s data files are stored in
${prefix}/share/gimp/2.0, where ${prefix} is set on install,
but is typically /usr/local. GIMP&rsquo;s system-wide
configuration files are stored in ${prefix}/etc/gimp/2.0.
Most GIMP configuration is read in from the user&rsquo;s
init file,</i> <b>$HOME</b><i>/.gimp-2.0/gimprc. The system
wide equivalent is in ${prefix}/etc/gimprc. The system wide
file is parsed first and the user gimprc can override the
system settings. ${prefix}/etc/gimprc_user is the default
gimprc placed in users&rsquo; home directories the first
time GIMP is run.</i></p>

are used.</i></p>

<p><i>Any bugs found should be reported to the online
bug-tracking system available on the web at
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/. Before reporting bugs, please
check to see if the bug has already been reported.</i></p>

<p><i>When reporting GIMP bugs, it is important to include
a reliable way to reproduce the bug, version number of GIMP
(and probably GTK), OS name and version, and any relevant
hardware specs. If a bug is causing a crash, it is very
useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of course,
patches to rectify the bug are even better.</i></p>

<p><i>The canonical place to find GIMP info is at
http://www.gimp.org/. Here you can find links to just about
many other GIMP sites, tutorials, data sets, mailing list
archives, and more.</i></p>

<p><i>There is also a GIMP User Manual available at
http://manual.gimp.org/ that goes into much more detail
about the interactive use of GIMP.</i></p>

<p><i>The latest version of GIMP and the GTK+ libs is
always available at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/.</i></p>

<p><i>Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis.</i></p>

<p><i>With patches, fixes, plugins, extensions, scripts,
translations, documentation, and more from lots and lots of
people all over the world.</i></p>
