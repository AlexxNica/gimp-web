<div class="heading">Tips and Tricks for user_install</div>
<p>
This is the dialog you see when you open The GIMP for the first time.  
</p>
<p>
There is probably no problem to just agree to all of the defaults. However,
The GIMP installation can use some tweaking here and there to make it appear
and behave perfectly for you.  Some of these options are set during this 
dialog.  
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Welcome</div>
<p>
Since this window mentions the GNU General Public License you know it is truly
a <cite>Welcome</cite> dialog you are entering into. ;) 
(<a href="ui-welcome.png">screenshot</a>).
</p>
<p>
Also, note the "Continue" button.  The GIMP does not even ask that you agree to
it, merely to continue.  Feel free to press the continue button.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Personal GIMP Directory</div>
<p>
I have always left this as is.  
</p>
<div class="subtitle">User Installation Log</div>
<p>
This window shows you the files that The GIMP will make.  It will have some
complaints if you told it to install some place that it didn't have permission
to be.  There is a scroll bar to see all the things The GIMP has for you.

<div class="subtitle">GIMP Performance Tuning</div>
<p>
Things to consider when setting the tile cache

/tmp might be a good place for the swap.

<div class="subtitle">Monitor Resolution</div>
<p>
Monitor Resolution is the ratio of

<li>Get Resolution from windowing system</li>
<li>Set Manually</li>
<li>Push the Calibrate Button</li>
</ol>
</p>
<div class="subtitle">The Calibrate Dialog</div>
<p>
My monitor was impressively off when I tried the Calibrate Dialog 
The Calibrate Game is fun to play.  You will need a soft ruler.
