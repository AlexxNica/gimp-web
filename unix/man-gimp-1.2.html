<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>GIMP</I> is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is used to edit and
manipulate images. It can load and save a variety of image formats and can
be used to convert between formats. 
<P>

Gimp can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of drawing and 
painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint brush. Painting 
and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a variety of paint modes.
It also offers an extensive array of selection tools like
rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color.  
<P>

Gimp offers a variety of plugins that perform a variety of image manipulations.
Examples include bumpmap, edge detect, gaussian blur, and many others. 
<P>

In addition, Gimp has several scripting extension which allow for advanced
non-interactive processing and creation of images.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>


The <I>gimp</I> accepts the following options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
Display a list of all commandline options.
<DT><B>-v, --version</B>

<DD>
Output the version info.
<DT><B>-b, --batch </B><I>&lt;commands&gt;</I>

<DD>
Execute the set of <I>&lt;commands&gt;</I> non-interactively. The set
of <I>&lt;commands&gt;</I> is typically in the form of a script that
can be executed by one of the Gimp scripting extensions.
<DT><B>-g, --gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternative gimprc instead of the default one. Useful in
cases where plugins paths or machine specs may be different.
<DT><B>-i, --no-interface</B>

<DD>
Run without a user interface.
<DT><B>-r, --restore-session</B>

<DD>
Try to restore saved session.
<DT><B>-d, --no-data</B>

<DD>
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful
in non-interactive situations where startup time is to be minimized.
<DT><B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Show startup messages.
<DT><B>--no-shm</B>

<DD>
Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its plugins. 
Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will send the data via pipe. This
will result in slower performance than using shared memory.
<DT><B>--no-xshm</B>

<DD>
Do not use the X Shared Memory extension. If GIMP is being displayed
on a remote X server, this probably needs to be enabled. Also useful
for any X server that doesn't properly support the X shared memory extension.
This will result in slower performance than with X shared memory enabled.
<DT><B>--display </B><I>display</I>

<DD>
Use the designated X display.
<DT><B>-s, --no-splash</B>

<DD>
Do not show the splash screen.
<DT><B>-S, --no-splash-image</B>

<DD>
Do not show the splash screen image as part of the splash screen.
<DT><B>--debug-handlers</B>

<DD>
Enable debugging signal handlers.
<DT><B>-c, --console-messages</B>

<DD>
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the messages on
the console instead.
<DT><B>--enable-stack-trace </B><I>{never|query|always}</I>

<DD>
If a stack-trace should be generated in case of fatal signals.
<DT><B>--system-gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternate system gimprc file.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>DISPLAY</B>

<DD>
to get the default host and display number.
<DT><B>XENVIRONMENT</B>

stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<P>
Gimp's data files are stored in ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2, where ${prefix} 
is set on install, but is typically /usr/local. Gimp's system-wide
configuration files are stored in ${prefix}/etc/gimp/1.2.
Most gimp configuration is read in from the user's init file,
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/gimprc. The system wide equivalent is in
${prefix}/etc/gimprc. The system wide file is parsed 
first and the user gimprc can override the system settings. 
${prefix}/etc/gimprc_user is the default gimprc
placed in users' home directories the first time gimp is run.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/gtkrc - users set of gimp-specific GTK 
config settings. Options such as widget color and fonts sizes 
can be set here.
<P>
${prefix}/etc/gimp/1.2/gtkrc - sytem wide default set of gimp-specific 
GTK config settings.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/ideas - lists all images that have been 
opened or saved using Gimp.
<P>

gimp parasites. This is file is recreated everytime gimp starts up.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/sessionrc - This file takes session-specific info 
(that is info, you want to keep between two gimp-sessions). You are
not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you
can do. This file will be entirely rewritten every time
you quit the gimp. If this file isn't found, defaults are used.
<P>
${prefix}/etc/gimp/1.2/unitrc - default user unit database. It
contains the unit definitions for centimeters, meters, feet, yards,
typographic points and typographic picas and is placed in users home
directories the first time the gimp is ran.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/unitrc - This file contains your user unit 
database. You can modify this list with the unit editor. You are 
not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you can do.
This file will be entirely rewritten every time you
quit the gimp.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins - location of user installed plugins.

and papers are stored here.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-1.2/levels - Level profiles and presets as saved from 
the Levels tool.
<P>

<H2>SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS</H2>

Any bugs found should be reported to the Gimp Developer mailing list
at <A HREF="mailto:gimp-developer@xcf.berkeley.edu">gimp-developer@xcf.berkeley.edu</A> or you may want to make use
of the online bug-tracking system available on the web at
<A HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html">http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgimp.html</A> or submit a bug report
to the system via <A HREF="http://www.xach.com/gimp/news/bugreport.html">http://www.xach.com/gimp/news/bugreport.html</A>
<P>
Before reporting bugs, please check to see if the bug is mentioned 
in the FAQ's or the mailing list archive. See the section on Other 
Info for locations of these.
<P>
When reporting Gimp bugs, it is important to include a
reliable way to reproduce the bug, version number of Gimp (and
probably GTK), OS name and version, and any relevant hardware
specs. It is also very important to include as much info as possible 
about the Xserver the problem was found on including at least server 
name, the visual, and the bit depth.
<P>
If a bug is causing a crash, it is very useful if a stack trace 
can be provided. And of course, patches to rectify the bug are even
better.
