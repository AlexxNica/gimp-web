<div class="heading">Tile Cache Recommendations</div>

<div class="subtitle">What is the Tile Cache?</div>
<p>
  Image processing can require a lot of memory. GIMP uses the
  operating system services to handle memory, up to a given point,
  past which it uses its own system so it does not eat all system
  memory resources. This system consists in sending old data to files
  in the disk. The decision point is what Tile Cache determines, the
  limit of operating system resources to use, and is measured in Bytes
  (or multiples, like MegaBytes). It does not include GIMP own memory,
  just the space required for the image data.
</p>
<p>
  A low value means that GIMP sends data really quickly to disk, not
  making real use of the avaliable RAM and making the disks work
  without real reason. A too high value, and the other applications
  start to have less system resources forcing them to swap space,
  which is making the disks work too, or maybe some will even get
  killed or start to malfunction due lack of RAM.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">How to choose a number for Tile Cache?</div>
<p>
  There are some ways to decide what value to use as Tile Cache, as
  well as some tricks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Forget about this and hope the default works. It worked when
    computers had few RAM and people just tried to make small images
    with GIMP while running one or two applications each time. If you
    want something easy and only use GIMP to make screenshoots and
    some logos, probably the best solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask someone to do it for you, which in the case of a computer
    serving multiple users at the same time can be a good idea, that
    way the administrator and other users do not get mad at you for
    abusing the machine, nor you get a badly underperfoming GIMP. If
    it is your machine and a single user at a given time, it could
    mean money, or drinks, as price for the service. ;]
  </li>
  <li>
    Start changing the value a bit each time and check that it goes
    faster and faster with each increase, but the systems does not
    complain about lack of memory. Be forewarned that sometimes lack
    of memory ends with some applications being killed to make space
    for the others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do some simple maths and calculate a viable value. Maybe you will
    have to tune it later, but maybe you have to tune it anyway with
    the other previous methods. At least you know what is happening
    and can get the best from your computer.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="subtitle">What number to use for Tile Cache?</div>
<p>
  Let's guess you prefer the last option, and get a nice value to
  start with. First, you need to get some data about your computer.
  This data is the RAM installed, the operating system's swap space
  avaliable and a general idea about the speed of the disks that store
  the operating system's swap and the directory used for GIMP's
  swap. You do not need to do disk tests, nor check the RPM of them,
  the thing is to see which one seems clearly faster or slower or all
  similar. Remember you can change the GIMP's swap directory in
  &lt;Toolbox&gt; -&lt; File -&lt; Preferences -&lt; Folders -&lt;
  Swap Dir.
</p>
<p>
  Next thing to do is to see how much resources you require for other
  apps you want to run at the same time than GIMP. So start all your
  tools and do some work with them, except GIMP of course, and check
  the usage. You can use applications like free or top, depends in
  what OS and what environment you use. The numbers you want is the
  memory left, including file cache. Modern UNIX keep a really small
  area free, to be able to keep big file and buffer caches. Linux's
  free does the maths for you, check the column that says
  &quot;free&quot;, and the line &quot;-/+ buffers/cache&quot;. Note
  down also the free swap.
</p>
<p>
  Now time for decissions and simple maths. Basically the concept is
  to decide if you want to base all Tile Cache in RAM, or RAM plus
  operating system swap:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Do you change applications a lot? Or keep working in GIMP for a
    long time? If you stay long times in GIMP, you can consider free
    RAM plus free swap as avaliable, or not, you have to check
    following points. If unsure about that times being long or not,
    check next steps too. If you are sure you switch all the apps
    every few time, only count free RAM and just go to final decision,
    no more things to check.
  </li>
  <li>
    Does operating system swap live in the same physical disk than
    GIMP swap? If so, add RAM and swap. Otherwise check next.
  </li>
  <li>
    The disk that holds the swap is faster or same speed than the disk
    that holds the GIMP swap? If slower, take only free RAM, if faster
    or similar, add free RAM and swap.
  </li>
  <li>
    You got a number, be it just the free RAM or the free RAM plus the
    free OS swap. Reduce it a bit, to be on the safe side, and that is
    the Tile Cache you could use as a good start.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As you can see, all is about checking the free resources, and decide
  if the OS swap is worth using or will cause more problems than help.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Tuning the value and other helpful
changes.</div>
<p>
  There are some reason you want to adjust the value. The basic one is
  changing your computer usage pattern, or changing hardware. That
  could mean you assumptions about how you use your computer, or the
  speed of it, are not longer valid. That would require a reevaluation
  of the previous steps, which can drive you to a similar value or a
  completly new value.
</p>
<p>
  Other reason to change the value is cos you detect it goes too slow
  inside GIMP but changing to other applications is fast, or that you
  get complains froms applications about now having enough memory.
</p>
<p>
  If you decided to use only RAM and it goes slow, you could try
  increasing the value a bit, but never to use also all the free swap.
  If the case is the contrary, using both RAM and swap, and you have
  problems about lack of resources, decrease it.
</p>
<p>
  More tricks are to put the Swap Dir in a very fast disk, or in a
  different disk than the rest of things. Spreading the operating
  system swap over multiple disks is also a good way to speed up
  things, in general. And of course, maybe you have to buy more RAM or
  stop using lots of programs at the same time, you can not expect to
  edit a poster in a computer with 16MB and be fast.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Some info about GIMP memory usage.</div>
<p>
  You can also check what memory requirements your images have. The
  bigger the images and the number of undos, the more resources you
  need. This is another way to choose a number, but it is only good if
  you always work in the same kind of images, and thus the real
  requirements do not vary. It is also good to know if you will
  require more RAM and/or disk space.

  Evil formulas go here.
