<p>gimprc &minus; gimp configuration file The file is a
configuation file read by the GIMP when it starts up. There
are two of these: one system-wide one stored in
${prefix}/etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc and a per-user
<b>$HOME</b>/.gimp-2.0/gimprc which may override system
settings.</p>

<p>Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue
until the end of the line. Blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p>The file associates values with properties. These
properties may be set by lisp-like assignments of the form:
<b>(</b><i>property-name value</i><b>)</b> where: is one of
the property names described below. is the value the
property is to be set to.</p>

<p>Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name
from the value. Valid properties and their default values
are:</p>

<p>(temp-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/tmp&quot;)</p>

<p>Sets the temporary storage directory. Files will appear
here during the course of running the GIMP. Most files will
disappear when the GIMP exits, but some files are likely to
remain, so it is best if this directory not be one that is
shared by other users. This is a single folder.</p>

<p>(swap-path &quot;${gimp_dir}&quot;)</p>

<p>Sets the swap file location. The gimp uses a tile based
memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly
and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that
the swap file can easily get very large if the GIMP is used
with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the
swap file is created on a directory that is mounted over
NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap
file in &quot;/tmp&quot;. This is a single folder.</p>

<p>(stingy-memory-use no)</p>

<p>There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and
speed. In most cases, the GIMP opts for speed over memory.
However, if memory is a big issue, try to enable this
setting. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

<p>(num-processors 1)</p>

<p>On multiprocessor machines, if GIMP has been compiled
with --enable-mp this sets how many processors GIMP should
use simultaneously. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(tile-cache-size 64M)</p>

<p>The tile cache is used to make sure the GIMP
doesn&rsquo;t thrash tiles between memory and disk. Setting
this value higher will cause the GIMP to use less swap
space, but will also cause the GIMP to use more memory.
Conversely, a smaller cache size causes the GIMP to use more
swap space and less memory. The integer size can contain a
suffix of &rsquo;B&rsquo;, &rsquo;K&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo;
or &rsquo;G&rsquo; which makes GIMP interpret the size as
being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.
If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being
specified in kilobytes.</p>

<p>(interpolation-type linear)</p>

<p>Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and
other transformations. Possible values are none, linear and
cubic.</p>

<p>Sets the module search path. This is a colon-separated
list of folders to search.</p>

<p>(environ-path

<p>Sets the environ search path. This is a colon-separated
list of folders to search.</p>

<p>(brush-path

list of folders to search.</p>

list.</p>

undo-size limit is reached. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(undo-size 4M)</p>

<p>Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image
to keep operations on the undo stack. Regardless of this
setting, at least as many undo-levels as configured can be
undone. The integer size can contain a suffix of
&rsquo;B&rsquo;, &rsquo;K&rsquo;, kilobytes, megabytes or

Possible values are tiny, extra-small, small, medium, large,
extra-large, huge, enormous and gigantic.</p>

<p>(pluginrc-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/pluginrc&quot;)</p>

<p>Sets the pluginrc search path. This is a single
filename.</p>

<p>(layer-previews yes)</p>

<p>Sets whether GIMP should create previews of layers and
channels. Previews in the layers and channels dialog are
nice to have but they can slow things down when working with
large images. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

<p>(layer-preview-size medium)</p>

<p>Sets the default preview size for layers and channels.
Possible values are tiny, extra-small, small, medium, large,

<p>Install a private colormap; might be useful on
pseudocolor visuals. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

the minimum number of system colors allocated for the GIMP.
This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(marching-ants-speed 300)</p>

<p>Speed of marching ants in the selection outline. This
value is in milliseconds (less time indicates faster
marching). This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(resize-windows-on-zoom no)</p>

<p>When enabled, the image window will automatically resize
itself, when zooming into and out of images. Possible values
are yes and no.</p>

<p>(resize-windows-on-resize no)</p>

<p>When enabled, the image window will automatically resize
itself, whenever the physical image size changes. Possible
values are yes and no.</p>

image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen. Possible values
are yes and no.</p>

<p>When enabled, this will ensure that the full image is
visible after a file is opened, otherwise it will be
displayed with a scale of 1:1. Possible values are yes and
no.</p>

<p>(perfect-mouse yes)</p>

<p>When enabled, the X server is queried for the
mouse&rsquo;s current position on each motion event, rather
than relying on the position hint. This means painting with
large brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower.
Perversely, on some X servers enabling this option results
in faster painting. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

<p>Sets the mode of cursor the GIMP will use. Possible
values are tool-icon, tool-crosshair and crosshair.</p>

an image that would take more memory than the size specified
here. The integer size can contain a suffix of
&rsquo;B&rsquo;, &rsquo;K&rsquo;, &rsquo;M&rsquo; or
&rsquo;G&rsquo; which makes GIMP interpret the size as being
specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no

<p>Strings of type PATH are expanded in a manner similar to
Specifically: tilde (~) is expanded to the user&rsquo;s home
directory. Note that the bash feature of being able to refer
to other user&rsquo;s home directories by writing ~userid/
is not valid in this file.</p>
