<p><i>gimp-remote</i> is a small utility that tells a
running GIMP to open one or more (local or remote) image
files. It does so by searching for a GIMP toolbox on the
active display. If it can find a GIMP toolbox, a synthetic
drop event is created which makes GIMP think the files would
have been dropped onto the toolbox. More than one filename
or URL can be specified on the commandline.</p>

<p>If no GIMP window is found, <i>gimp-remote</i> will
start a new GIMP instance and ask it to load the specified
images. If no filename or URL is given, <i>gimp-remote</i>
will start a new GIMP. This behaviour can be altered using
the command-line options described below.</p>

<p><i>gimp-remote</i> accepts the following options:
Display a list of all commandline options. Output the
version info. Use the designated X display. If no running
GIMP instance is found, don&rsquo;t start a new one but
exit. Check if GIMP is running and exit. A status code of 0
indicates that a GIMP toolbox window has been found on this
display.</p>

<p>Loads the image from the GIMP website into a running
GIMP or starts a new one. Loads the local files wilber.xcf
and wilma.xcf into a running GIMP or starts a new one.</p>

<p>to get the default host and display number.</p>
