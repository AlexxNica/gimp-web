<h2>NAME</h2>

gimprc - gimp configuration file
<a NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The
<b>gimprc</b>

file is a configuation file read by the gimp when it starts up.  There
are two of these: one system-wide one stored in
${prefix}/etc/gimp/1.2/gimprc and a per-user <b>$HOME</b>/.gimp-1.2/gimprc
which may override system settings.
<p>
Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the
end of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

<p>
The
<b>gimprc</b>

file associates values with properties.  These properties may be set
by lisp-like assignments of the form:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><dd>
<b>(</b><i>property-name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value</i><b>)</b>
<dt>where:<dd>
<dt><i>property-name</i>

<dd>
is one of the property names described below.
<dt><i>value</i>

<dd>
is the value the property is to be set to.
</dl>
<p>

<p>
Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.
<p>
The values have an associated type, described below:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><i>STRING</i>

<dd>
A sequence of characters surrounded by double-quotes (&quot;).  A backslash
(\) may be used to escape either double-quote or itself to generate a
literal double-quote or a literal backslash.
<dt><i>PATH</i>

<dd>
Same as STRING, but path-expansion (see below) is also performed.
<dt><i>DOUBLE</i>

<dd>
An optional minus sign (-) followed by zero or more decimal digits,
and optionally a decimal-point (.) followed by zero or more decimal
digits.
<dt><i>FLOAT</i>

<dd>
Same as DOUBLE.
<dt><i>INT</i>

<dd>
Same as DOUBLE, except the value is rounded to the next lowest integer.
<dt><i>BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
One of
<b>true</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>yes</b>, 


<b>false</b>, <b>off</b>, or <b>no</b>.

Alternatively, the empty string is interpreted to mean
<b>true</b>.

<dt><i>POSITION</i>

<dd>
Same as two INTs separated by whitespace.
<dt><i>MEMSIZE</i>

<dd>

An INT followed by a size specifier.  A size specifier is one of
<b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, 

<b>k</b>, <b>K</b>, 

<b>b</b>, or <b>B</b>.

The size specified may be omitted, in which case it defaults to
<b>k</b>.

<dt><i>IMAGETYPE</i>

<dd>
One of
<b>rgb</b>, <b>grey</b>, or <b>gray</b>.

<dt><i>COLORCUBE</i>

<dd>
Four whitespace separated INTs, giving the number of shades of red,
green, blue and grey (respectively) in the color cube.
<dt><i>PREVIEWSIZE</i>

<dd>
One of
<b>none</b>, tiny<b>, </b>small<b>, </b>medium<b>, large</b> or <b>huge</b>, 

or an INT.  tiny is 24x24, small is 32x32, medium is 48x48, 
large is 64x64 and huge is 128x128.
<dt><i>UNIT</i>

<dd>

One of
<b>inches</b>, <b>millimeters</b>, <b>picas</b>, or <b>points</b>

or the identifier of one of the units you have defined in your user
units database.

<h2>PROPERTIES</h2>

Valid properties and their types:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><i>temp-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the temporary storage directory. Files will appear here
during the course of running the gimp.  Most files will disappear
when the gimp exits, but some files are likely to remain,
such as working palette files, so it is best if this directory
not be one that is shared by other users or is cleared on machine
reboot such as /tmp.
<dt><i>swap-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the swap file location. The gimp uses a tile based memory
allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily
swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file
can easily get very large if the gimp is used with large images.
Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on 
a directory that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons, it may 
be desirable to put your swap file in &quot;/tmp&quot;.
<dt><i>brush-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the brush search path. This is a colon-separated list of
directories to be searched for brushes.
<dt><i>pattern-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the pattern search path.  This is a colon-separated list of
directories to be searched for patterns.
<dt><i>plug-in-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the plug-in search path. This is a colon-separated list of
directories which will be scanned at startup to register new plugins.
<dt><i>palette-path PATH</i>

<dd>

Set the palette search path.  This is a colon-separated list of
directories to be searched for palettes.
<dt><i>gradient-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the gradient search path.  This is a colon-separated list of
directories to be searched for gradients.
<dt><i>module-path PATH</i>

<dd>
Set the module search path. This is a colon-separated list of
directories which will be scanned at startup for modules to be loaded.
<dt><i>default-brush STRING</i>

<dd>
Specify a default brush.  This doesn't actually do anything any more,
since the default brush is set as part of the saved device status.
<dt><i>default-pattern STRING</i>

<dd>
Specify a default pattern. The pattern is searched for in the
specified pattern path.
<dt><i>default-palette STRING</i>

<dd>
Specify a default palette.  The palette is searched for in the
specified palette path.
<dt><i>default-gradient STRING</i>

<dd>
Specify a default gradient. The gradient is searched for in the
specified gradient path.
<dt><i>gamma-correction DOUBLE</i>

<dd>

Set the gamma correction value for the display.  1.0 corresponds to no
gamma correction.  For most displays, gamma correction should be set
to between 2.0 and 2.6 Run the utility &quot;gamma_correct&quot; to determine
appropriate values for your display.  XXX is this valid info?  One
important item to keep in mind: Many images that you might get from
outside sources will in all likelihood already be gamma-corrected.  In
these cases, the image will look washed-out if the gimp has
gamma-correction turned on.  If you are going to work with images of
this sort, turn gamma correction off by setting the value to 1.0.
<dt><i>color-cube COLORCUBE</i>

<dd>
Set the displays color cube.  No longer used in gimp-1.2.x since the
introduction of GdkRgb.
<dt><i>install-colormap BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Install a private colormap by default - not actually used anymore since
the introduction of GdkRgb.
<dt><i>tile-cache-size MEMSIZE</i>

<dd>
The tile cache is used to make sure the gimp doesn't thrash
tiles between memory and disk. Setting this value higher will
cause the gimp to use less swap space, but will also cause
the gimp to use more memory. Conversely, a smaller cache size
causes the gimp to use more swap space and less memory.
Note: the gimp will still run even if `tile-cache-size' is
set to 0. The actual size can contain a suffix of 'm', 'M',

size as being specified in megabytes, kilobytes and bytes
respectively. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to
being specified in kilobytes.
<dt><i>marching-ants-speed INT</i>

<dd>
Speed of marching ants in the selection outline.  This value is in
milliseconds (less time indicates faster marching).
<dt><i>last-opened-size INT</i>

<dd>
How many recently opened image filenames to keep on the File menu.
<dt><i>undo-levels INT</i>

<dd>
Set the number of operations kept on the undo stack.

<dt><i>transparency-type INT</i>

<dd>
Set the manner in which transparency is displayed in images.
Transparency type can be one of 0 - Light Checks, 1 - Mid-Tone Checks,
2 - Dark Checks, 3 - White Only, 4 - Gray Only, or 5 - Black Only.
<dt><i>transparency-size INT</i>

<dd>
Check size can be one of 0 - Small, 1 - Medium, or 2 - Large
<dt><i>perfect-mouse BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
If set to true, the X server is queried for the mouse's current
position on each motion event, rather than relying on the position
hint.  This means painting with large brushes should be more accurate,
but it may be slower.  Perversely, on some X servers turning on this
option results in faster painting.
<dt><i>colormap-cycling BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Specify that marching ants for selected regions will be drawn with
colormap cycling as oposed to redrawing with different stipple masks.
This color cycling option works only with 8-bit displays.
<dt><i>default-threshold INT</i>

<dd>
Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a
seed-fill algorithm.  The seed fill starts at the intially selected
pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel
intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold.
This value represents the default threshold.
<dt><i>stingy-memory-use BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
There is always a tradeoff between memory usage and speed.  In most
cases, the GIMP opts for speed over memory.  However, if memory is a
big issue, set stingy-memory-use.
<dt><i>allow-resize-windows BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>

When zooming into and out of images, this option enables the automatic
resizing of windows.
<dt><i>dont-allow-resize-windows BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of allow-resize-windows.
<dt><i>cursor-updating BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Context-dependent cursors are cool.  They are enabled by default.
However, they require overhead that you may want to do without.
<dt><i>no-cursor-updating BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of cursor-updating.
<dt><i>preview-size PREVIEWSIZE</i>

<dd>
Set the layer preview size.
<dt><i>show-rulers BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Set the ruler visibility. The default behavior is for rulers to be on.
This can also be toggled with the View-&gt;Toggle Rulers command or
shift+control+r.
<dt><i>dont-show-rulers BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of show-rulers.
<dt><i>show-statusbar BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Controlling statusbar visibility. The default behavior is to show the
statusbar.  This can also be toggled with the View-&gt;Toggle Statusbar
command or shift+control+s.
<dt><i>dont-show-statusbar BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of show-statusbar.
<dt><i>auto-save BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Auto saving is not yet implemented! Nothing will be auto-saved, no
matter how you set this.
<dt><i>dont-auto-save BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>

Negated version of auto-save.
<dt><i>cubic-interpolation BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Set the level of interpolation.  If set, this option enables cubic
interpolation when scaling or transforming.  By default, GIMP uses
linear interpolation, which is faster, but has poorer quality.
<dt><i>confirm-on-close BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Ask for confirmation before closing an image without saving. This is
the default.
<dt><i>dont-confirm-on-close BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of confirm-on-close.
<dt><i>save-session-info BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Remember the positions and sizes of the main dialogs and asks your
window-manager to place them there again the next time you use the
GIMP.
<dt><i>dont-save-session-info BOOLEAN</i>

<dd>
Negated version of save-session-info.
<dt><i>save-device-status BOOLEAN</i>

This units will be used for coordinate display when not in dot-for-dot
mode. The default units can be one of inches , millimeters, points or
picas or the identifier of one of the units defined in your user units
database. The default is inches.
<dt><i>default-xresolution FLOAT</i>

<dd>

File/New dialog. This value is always in dpi (dots per inch).
<dt><i>default-yresolution FLOAT</i>

<dd>
Set the default vertical resolution for new images and for the
File/New dialog. This value is always in dpi (dots per inch).
<dt><i>default-resolution-units UNIT</i>

<h2>PATH EXPANSION</h2>

Strings of type PATH are expanded in a manner similar to

<b><a HREF="/cgi-bin/man2html?bash+1">bash</a></b>(1).

Specifically: tilde (~) is expanded to the user's home directory, and
${variable} is expanded to the current value of the variable.  Note
that the bash feature of being able to refer to other user's home
directories by writing ~userid/ is not valid in this file.
<p>
The only variable initially defined is
<i>gimp_dir</i>

, which is set to either the interned value
<b>.gimp-1.2</b>

or the environment variable GIMP_DIRECTORY.  If the path in
GIMP_DIRECTORY is relative, it is considered relative to your home
directory.  The same variable expansion syntax can be used to refer to
environment variables.  New variables may be defined so long as their
name does not shadow one of the property names given in the previous
section.  Variables are set using the following syntax:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><dd>
<b>(</b><i>variable-name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH</i><b>)</b>

</dl>
<p>

Note that the right hand side of this assignment is itself path
expanded before setting the value of the variable.
<p>
Typically, the system-wide gimprc file will set a few convenience
variables:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt><i>prefix</i>

<dd>
The installation prefix for this build, /usr/local.
<dt><i>exec_prefix</i>

<dd>
The path to architecture-specific executables, ${prefix}.

<dt><i>gimp_data_dir</i>

<dd>
Path to sharable data, ${prefix}/share/gimp/1.2.
<dt><i>gimp_plugin_dir</i>

<dd>
Base for paths to architecture-specific plugins and modules,
${exec_prefix}/lib/gimp/1.2.
</dl>
<p>
