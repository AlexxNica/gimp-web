<div class="subtitle">List Etiquette</div>
<p>
  When sending mails to the lists there are some recommendations you
  should follow, at least in The Gimp official lists, but probably are
  nice for all lists to make everyone life easier:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Stay on topic. If things go off topic, use direct mail. Gimp User
  list topics are user problems, techniques, hardware advice (tablets,
  scanners, monitors), request for comments about images and usage in
  general. Gimp Devel list topics are coding, patches, bugs and other
  Gimp's guts things.
  </li>
  <li>
  English is the official languaje of the lists. There is people from
  all around the globe so we use it. If you have problem with English,
  a small note about it is enough. Saying which languajes do you speak
  better will also help, maybe someone can help clarifying the obscure
  parts of your mail.
  </li>
  <li>
  Before reporting problems, check again. Make sure you are following
  the intructions correctly and that your version is not old (or that
  the problem also appears in modern versions). If you can get a
  friend to test your problem in other computer, better, maybe you
  discover what is your problem, or can provide info about what cases
  are free (for example bugs that only happen in Alpha computers).
  </li>
  <li>
  Do not use HTML. Some people will have problems to view the mails
  and will ignore you even if they have alternative methods to view it
  (like reading the HTML code or launching a browser). Other will
  flame you (some maybe even have bot for that). So to be sure
  everyone can read it, use plain text mail.
  </li>
  <li>
  Only useful attachments, and if small. If it is more than a few KB
  (say more than 10), you should (must?) upload somewhere and post the
  URL instead.
  </li>
  <li>
  Use (the best) compression you can find for attachments or URLs.
  Remember that you can compress .xcf files with gzip or bzip2
  (.xcf.gz or .xcf.bz2, respec.). Those compressors are free and
  gratis and at least gzip should be handled by all Gimp version I
  know, so no excuses. For images you can use PNG (ie when showing bad
  results and you need the image to be the one you are seeing in your
  monitor) or JPEG (asking how to do something, so if the image is a
  bit damaged due JPEG algorithm, it does not matter).
  </li>
  <li>
  Cut text lines to 70 or so chars, so it can be viewed anywhere. If
  you have a big screen, good for you, others do not or just want to
  use the big monitor to have more than one thing on screen at the
  same time. Most mail apps should do it for you.
  </li>
  <li>
  Try to use a monospace (typewriter, non proportional) font when
  reading or writing mails. For common mails it will not be important,
  but if someone post a text figure (ASCII art) to explain something,
  it will look really bad if you use other font (in that case it is a
  must, not a recommendation). In the same style, do not use tabs, use
  spaces instead, that way everyone will see the same.
  </li>
  <li>
  Do not expect people to see other character sets beyond 7 bit ASCII
  and images supported by Gimp. You can hope they will, but do not
  think they will. The same applies to you, if you see text with weird
  characters, maybe your computer has no support for them. Or you do
  not have the loader plug-in for Gimp, if the problem is an error
  with an image. Be permisive about these problems and never force
  them (aka do not send things you are sure most people will be unable
  to see, and make sure your mailer sets the correct MIME type, not a
  general one).
  </li>
  <li>
  When replying to messages, quote the important phrases to give
  context. Use something like &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt; &quot;
  (yep, &quot;$gt;&quot; and space), &quot;]&quot; or any other
  character(s) that seem logical. As most repetitive things, your mail
  app should do it for you. But do not include the full mail again,
  select that part not useful and delete them (yeah, another thing
  computers can do, delete full areas).
  </li>
  <li>
  Do not write all in one big chunk, use blank lines to separate
  things. Also use blank lines to separate your text from quoted
  text. Try to read 100 lines of text in one paragraph, then the same
  text with some blank lines, each 5-10 lines (20-10 paragraphs).
  Some people just ignore the things that they can not read easily.
  </li>
  <li>
  No auto replies ("I am on holidays"). They just waste space, and
  people will think they got something when they are only talking to a
  bot. Unsubscribe or set you subscription to no mail mode if you
  need.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you have few time, you can filter the messages. Message headers
  can help a lot to make your life easier, most mail apps can filter
  by headers, or use a helper app for that. The subjects have tags to
  help you identify mail if you sort by hand all incoming mail in one
  mailbox. You can delete the tag and use different mailbox too (use
  other header as filter, like X-BeenThere). Another option is to
  receive the mails in digest mode, all in one mail, so it saves space
  and you can scan the on-going talks quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
  When posting reports, paste all the interesting info. Use common
  (hehehe) sense to decide what, you do not need to post the size of
  the computer box, but be ready to provide more info in next mails. A
  good start is a small description of the computer (CPU family and
  OS) plus versions of related software (Gimp, libraries, compiler)
  and the steps you followed to find the problem (write your &quot;How
  to crash Gimp in X steps with Y tool&quot; tutorial). If you have
  the solution, even better. ;]
  </li>
  <li>
  If you receive spam, do not reply to it. The list has filters, but
  they are not perfect. The best way to handle garbage is to ignore
  it. In general, you should delete spam, via list or direct, cos the
  best solution is to desintegrate the spammers, and the second best
  to ignore them (guess which one is legal).
  </li>
  <li>
  No spam like mails allowed. No chain letters, no virus alarms, only
  Gimp. I think that while some rules are more recommendations, this
  is a real rule, so real that you could get kicked out of the list.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you have doubts about the rules, read the archives. Or subscribe
  and just read it until you see how things are. We do not bite people
  for just reading, but some can get very unfriendly with those that
  ignore the basic rules. We do not ask for ultra complex things and
  etiquette, but things that computers can do for you and a nice
  behaviour on the rest. Most (if not all) of the rules have been in
  use for very long on Internet (they are a tradition, but what is
  more important is that they work).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Conclusion: the faster, easier and cheaper people can see what is
  going in the mails, the better for all. And the topic is Gimp.
