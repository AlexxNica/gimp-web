        i feel that the screenshots should only be resized when
        necessary. i think the original screenshots should be
        maintained as often as possible, due to the nature of the
        tutorials.  to make the screenshots follow the doc rules means
        to make at least one part of one of the tutorials not apply,
        for instance.  my window manager sends information to the
        window decoration.  i think this is significant as i never
        told it to (percentage of view and mode) but have always
        appreciated the info occuring there.
