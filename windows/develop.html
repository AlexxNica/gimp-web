<h2 class="heading">How to help develop the GIMP</h2>

<p>GIMP is developed mostly under Linux, but it may be compiled for other systems such as Windows too.
</p>

<p>
<strong>WARNING: none of the GIMPs on these pages are 'official'. You take your own chances. The only official GIMPs are those available in source format (not executable) at <a  href="ftp://ftp.gimp.org">ftp.gimp.org</a>.</strong>
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Programming</h3>
<p>Most GIMP coders use the Linux platform, and you'll probably find that things go a lot easier if you do also.</p>

<p>If you're not a programmer, you can help the GIMP grow in many other ways. Help </p>

<ul>
<li>write documentation,</li>
<li>translate the GIMP,</li>
<li>translate the documentation,</li>
<li>write tutorials,</li>
<li>make artwork used in or with the GIMP,</li>
<li>make sure that people know you used the GIMP for your artwork,</li>
<li>sell or give away copies of the GIMP, or</li>
<li>help others to learn to use the GIMP.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you see, it does not really matter whether you can program or not. Of course, programmers are extremely valuable to the project, perhaps even more so Windows programmers, but there are many other ways in which you can contribute.</p>

<p>If you decide to 'evangelize', though, try and stay civil. You catch more flies with honey than with that other stuff.</p>
