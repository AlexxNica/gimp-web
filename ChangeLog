2004-12-07  Simon Budig <simon@gimp.org>

	* about/splash/contest/index.htrw: Add a link to Mukund's voting
	site together with a disclaimer that the result there not
	necessarily will reflect the final result.

2004-12-06  Dave Neary <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* index.htrw: Update splash contest news item to reflect
	the fact that the contest is closed. Fixed invalid xhtml
	while I was at it.

	sites.

2004-12-05  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/admin/contest/gallery-edit.py (display_gallery): 
	Some visual changes in the indicator of where the currently
	display page is versus the total of all gallery images.

	Code cleanup and refactoring.  Gallery edit now displays 12 images per page.

	* programmatic/admin/wgo-admin.cpp:
	Added new definitions for CSS attributes for the gallery.

2004-12-03  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

2004-12-01  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/contest/contest.py (submit_manually): 
	Fixed up manual addition by fixing the DataDir problem.

	* programmatic/admin/news/news-edit.py:
	Try to make editing the date of a news article easier by including
	some descriptive text about the date format.

	* programmatic/admin/news/:
	Updated list of icons to allow for news entries.  Fixed the XML
	rdf/rss preview button on the news admin pages to work around the
	DocumentRoot versus DataDir problem mentioned below

	* programmatic/contest/:
	Get the contest back up and running.  Changes to update programmes
	to work around missing info in the top-level configuration.

	DocumentRoot and DataDir are environment variables set at the
	top-level installation script, but there is nothing to indicate
	where the DataDir is in relation to DocumentRoot.  As a result
	hackery has been employed in the scripts and sub-level Makefiles
	to work around and make assumptions about this missing
	information.  This hackery has been incomplete and, as a result,
	the whole mess has been totally busted.

	* index2.html:
	Alternative home page to display automatically generated news.

	* programmatic/admin/news/icons/wilber_painter.png
	* programmatic/admin/news/icons/wilber_wizard.png
	* programmatic/admin/news/icons/wilber_work.png

	submission info for now.

	* unix/index.htrw: fiddled with the layout a bit.

	These links point to the pages in the Unix section but
	configuration is not really platform-dependant and should probably
	be moved elsewhere.

	leaders and added the name of the gimp2 portfile maintainer

	should list free downloads before any GIMP vendors.

	* source/index.htrw: fixed anchor.

	* unix/index.htrw: fixed brokeness I introduced earlier today.

	sell the GIMP, what are the GPL requirements, etc.

	has been renamed.  Added new link to submit bug reports related to
	ftp mirrors instead of submitting them to the www.gimp.org
	component.  Added links to my e-mail address and web page.
	Updated link Package-GIMP-windows, although it is not used
	anywhere.

	related to the ftp mirrors.

	suppress the <!-- This file was automatically generated
	from... --> comment at the top of every file.  These comments
	prevent the site from working with MS IE.

	A better solution would be to move the comment below the

	* windows/index.htrw: Changed a sentence that Branko wanted to change
	before the move.

2004-03-12  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* tutorials/Photo_To_Sketch/index.htrw: Removed dead link.
	* admin/gimp-web-urls: ditto

2004-03-12  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* tutorials/3d_Logo/logo-*.png: Use the 29 new screenshots
	contributed by Harish Narayanan <harish@gamebox.net> for 2.0.
	Minor modifications to logo-06.png and logo-25.png to restore the
	transparent background.

2004-03-11  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* Makefile (all): Rewhacked things to make news work.

2004-03-11  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* macintosh/index.htrw: Updated the link to the DarwinPorts
	project.

	* tutorials/index.htrw: Moved the Simple Floating Logo tutorial
	(a.k.a "The Basics") back to the Beginner section as suggested by
	Yosh.

	* programmatic/downloads/MIRRORS: Updated the list of mirrors
	according to the latest updates that I made on the ftp site.

2004-03-11  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* tutorials/Photo_To_Sketch/index.htrw: Updated the photo to 
	sketch tutorial text for 2.0. I'll updated the screenshots in 
	a while.

2004-03-10  Niklas M <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Add GIMP-web mailinglist links.
	* mail_lists.htrw: Add gimp-web to the mailinglists.
	* bugs/howtos/bugzilla.htrw: Changed 2 links that was not being
	changed during the build of the site.
	* about/index.htrw: Removed link to google.

2004-02-17  Niklas M <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Changed original links to the Photo Edit
	tutorials provided by Eric Jeschke. Got a mail from him about this.

2004-01-15  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: changed home:gimp-bugzilla-wgo-submit to
	match new bugzilla product. Fixes part of bug #131580.

2004-01-07  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.css: Replaced "div.news img" by "p.news img" because
	the images have been inside a <p> and not a <div> since a while.

	* includes/news.inc: Added &nbsp; at the end of the headings for
	these sample news items in order to avoid strange display
	artifacts due to the fact that both <span> elements included in
	<h1> have "float" set in the style sheet.

	* includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml:
	* includes/wgo-develop-fini.xhtml:
	* includes/wgo-tutorial-fini.xhtml:
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml: Updated copyright year to 2004.

2004-01-05  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* resources/index.htrw: Removed the visible FIXME, added a comment
	saying that some downloadable files will be available soon.

	* Makefile: If news.inc is not present in the target directory,
	install it so that the site can be bootstrapped (this is a kludge
	that should be removed later, when the news are stored in CVS).
	Added some comments about other things that should be fixed soon
	after the move.

	* includes/news.inc: Changed the default news items.  The old ones
	did not work with the new style sheet.

2004-01-03  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* source/index.htrw: Removed the visible FIXME, explained what are
	the different versions of the source code, added some links.

	* downloads/install_help.htrw: Removed the visible FIXME.  This
	page should be removed soon and its contents should be transfered
	to the source section or to the platform-specific pages.

	* macintosh/index.htrw: Removed the visible FIXME, added a
	reference to the unix page for the configuration details.

	* downloads/index.htrw: Added an anchor for the mirrors.

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Added several urls: download page, list of
	mirrors, classic.gimp.org, etc.

2003-11-24  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/includes/wgo-admin-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-develop-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-howto-bugs-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-howto-source-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-howto-unix-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-tutorial-init.xhtml: added id="wwwgimporg" to the
	body element in order to help those who would like to override
	some of our styles in their personal style sheet (bug #127811).

2003-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* books/index.htrw: removed trailing slash; fixes #125598.

2003-10-06  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* style/wgo.css: Removed "div.news p".

2003-09-26  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.css (div.news): replaced "clear: top", which is not
	valid CSS, by "clear: both".  The result does not look much better
	and I do not know why this style was created.  See the discussion
	in bug #123123.  See also:
	http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html

	* programmatic/admin/news/wgo_news.py (icon_descs): Added
	descriptions for the icons so that we get better alt tags.  This
	is not a perfect solution, but this should fix bug #117380 once
	the news are rebuilt.

2003-09-24  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* links/index.htrw: Added a link to /about/linking.html.

	* unix/fonts.htrw: Added correct links to urw-fonts.tar.gz and
	fonts.dir after copying these files on the FTP server.

	* unix/index.htrw: Improved the description of links to the AIX
	versions of the GIMP.  Added a link to a query for GIMP at
	rpmfind.net.

	* unix/.cvsignore: Regenerated.

	* resources/index.htrw: Removed a stray --> (end of comment) that
	was breaking the build.

	* team.htrw: Be fair.  And be accented.

2003-09-23  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* team.htrw: Removed all e-mail addresses from the page until we
	can decide what to do about them (it is easy to add them back if
	we decide to do that).  Put myself as coordinator.  This has been
	effective since after GimpCon, but the page had not been updated.
	Moved Carol to the Contributors section.  I would like to use
	something nicer than Contributor, but I do not know what to put
	there.

	* unix/index.htrw: Added a link to fonts.html.

	* unix/fonts.htrw: Added this new file describing how to install
	fonts for the GIMP.  For the most part, this is copying the info
	that I updated some time ago for the old web site.

2003-09-23 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /resources/index.htrw: Commented out links that has no content.

2003-09-23 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* wgo-howto-bugs-init.xhtml
	* wgo-howto-source-init.xhtml
	* wgo-howto-unix-init.xhtml
	* wgo-tutorial-init.xhtml: Added "Resources" again.

2003-09-23  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.css: Added #titlebar to the sections that should not
	be printed.  Clean-up: removed the sections that had been
	commented out by drc.  Fixes bug #122984.

2003-09-22  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* programmatic/about/Makefile: Disabled building and installation
	of ChangeLogs.

	* about/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/admin/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/admin/news/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/contest/.cvsignore: Regenerated.

	* contest/.cvsignore
	* resources/.cvsignore
	* resources/brushes/.cvsignore
	* resources/gradients/.cvsignore
	* resources/palettes/.cvsignore
	* resources/patterns/.cvsignore: Added, as a consequence of the
	previous renaming of some .html files to .htrw in a previous
	commit.  Files generated with "make cvsignore".

	* includes/wgo-xhtml-init.xhtml: Move the comment with the CVS Id
	below the <html> tag.  This fixes bug #122932.

	* Makefile: Add current working directory as prefix because using
	only programmatic: was causing problems with some older versions
	of GNU make.

	* programmatic/downloads/Makefile (install): create the downloads
	directory in the DocumentRoot in order to avoid problems during
	the first-time installation.

	* programmatic/tools/rewrite_attrs.py (xhtml_parser): Modify the
	code so that it waits until the first HTML comment in the input
	before inserting its own comment.  This fixes one part of bug
	#122932.  Also added the option "-s" to strip out the HTML
	comments from the output.

2003-09-22  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* downloads/install_help.htrw: Added a mention about the build
	time for current CVS using a relatively old machine (P3).  This
	will be moved to the source section later.

	* windows/index.htrw: Added a note about the CDs available for
	purchase from www.wingimp.org.

	* macintosh/index.htrw: Added direct link to the XDarwin project,
	as suggested by Mat Caughron.

	* ChangeLogs/1.2.3/*
	* ChangeLogs/*: Removed all these files.  They will have to be
	based on a copy of the ChangeLog(s) that is fetched automatically
	from gimp CVS.  In addition, the e-mail addresses will have to be
	stripped out or obfuscated and the structure of the pages should
	be a bit different.

	* unix/howtos/bugzilla.htrw: Renamed all remaining .html files
	that were containing SSI code to .htrw, to ensure that no SSI
	statements are used in the whole site.  Now it is possible to test
	everything on a web server that has no SSI support.

	* unix/howtos/template-in.html: Removed.

	* about/linking.htrw: Small XHTML correction in the example code.

2003-09-21  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* index.htrw: Changed the text according to the suggestions from
	Dave Neary in bug #119210, with slight modifications due to the
	fact that we do not distribute patches and plug-ins directly from
	here.

	* windows/index.htrw: Added a link to www.wingimp.org.

	* downloads/index.htrw: Removed the direct links to some binaries
	because they were duplicating the information from the platform-
	specific sections and they were not complete anyway.  This should
	fix bug	#119562.

	* downloads/install_help.htrw: Mention that the page should be
	removed soon.

2003-09-21  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* about/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/admin/develop/.cvsignore: Regenerated.

	* about/index.htrw: Added a link to linking.html.

	* about/linking.htrw: New page describing how other sites can link
	to us, and providing some buttons and images that can be freely
	copied (see bug #116523 for details).

	* images/wilber_the_gimp.png
	* images/wilber_the_gimp2.png
	* images/wilber_the_gimp_idx.png
	* images/wilber_painter.png
	* images/wilber_painter_idx.png
	* images/wilber_work.png
	* images/wilber_wizard.png: Several PNG images of Wilber (based on
	the Wilber Construction Kit) that can be freely copied and used by
	other sites.

	* images/gfx_by_gimp.png
	* images/gimp_free_button.png: PNG versions of old GIF images,
	suitable for usage by other sites linking to us.

	* images/old/wilber_the_gimp.gif
	* images/old/wilber_painter.gif
	* images/old/frontpage.gif
	* images/old/frontpage.png
	* images/old/frontpage_idx.png
	* images/old/gfx_by_gimp.gif
	* images/old/gimp_free_button.gif: Old GIF images that were
	directly linked by a large number of other sites (bug #116523).

	* images/old/README: Some explanations for those who get there.

	* images/external_404.png: New image to which old images should be
	redirected so that other sites linking to us see immediately that
	some things have changed.

	* Makefile: removed the old .ssi rules.  Added a rule "target" for
	those who read the usage message literally.

	* .cvsignore: Added make.out.

2003-09-21  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* ./install.sh: Save make output into make.out

2003-09-20  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/admin/develop/Makefile (install-first): install
	  index.html in /admin/develop

2003-09-21  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* os2/index.htrw: I forgot to add the "Configuration" section.

	* links/index.htrw: Change the anchors to be empty instead of
	enclosing the text of the h2 elements, because this caused all
	headings to be highlighted as if they were links.  Removed the
	extra empty paragraphs.  Reformatted the code a bit, like in some
	other pages.

	* links/.cvsignore: Added this file to take care of the new files
	created by Niklas.

	* unix/index.htrw: SunFreeware is a .com, not .org.  Mention Mike
	Sweet's name in the link to his page.

	* windows/index.htrw: Better description of the differences
	between the installer and the zip archives.  This should really
	fix bug #119539, this time.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /unix/index.htrw: Commented out "File -> Preferenses" and 
	"Help Documentation" again.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /includes/wgo-admin-init.xhtml
	* /includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml: Fixed these files because they broke
	the layout of the site when going to admin pages. Also add a few extra
	breaks to make the menu look better.

2003-09-21  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* unix/index.htrw
	* windows/index.htrw
	* macintosh/index.htrw
	* os2/index.htrw: Re-organized the platform-specific sections so
	that they share a similar structure: "Getting and Installing the
	GIMP", "Requirements", "Configuration", "Help and Documentation".
	This should fix bug #119537, bug #119538 and bug #119539.

	* style/wgo.css (help, acronym): added new style for elements that
	have a title (help tip).

	* develop/index.htrw: Recycled some parts of the Mac section "Your
	support" (now gone) to revise the first part of this page.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /unix/index.htrw: Commented out "Help Documentation" and 
	"File -->Preferences".

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /unix/index.htrw: Add "/downloads/INSTALL" as file for the
	"Installation Instructions" link.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /docs/index.htrw: Commented out "The GIMP Documentation".
	* /os2/index.htrw: Add a link to os2files for "OS/2 Software".
	* /includes/wgo-xhtml-fini.xhtml: Commented out Validation link.
	
	* /unix/man-gimp-1.2.html
	* /unix/man-gimp-remote-1.2.html
	* /unix/man-gimprc.1.html
	* /unix/man-gimptool-1.2.html: Removed 2 characters that broke the
	files a little.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /includes/urls_go-utility.inc: Removed two broken links.

2003-09-21 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /links/org.html, index.html: Removed files.
	* /links/index.htrw: Fixed broken link to mailinglists. Removed include
	link to a file that Raphaël hve removed. Removed the (dis) in the
	header for Organisation.
	* /links/org.htrw: Removed broken links.
	
	* /includes/wgo-howto-bugs-init.xhtml
	* /includes/wgo-howto-source-init.xhtml
	* /includes/wgo-howto-unix-init.xhtml
	* /includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* /includes/wgo-tutorial-init.xhtml: Removed "Resources" and "Contest"
	from main menu.

2003-09-20  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* downloads/.cvsignore: Updated the file with "make cvsignore".

	* downloads/install_help.html
	* downloads/install_help.htrw: Renamed the .html file to .htrw,
	fixed several typos, updated the requirements (still needs some
	work), cleaned up the formatting.

	* downloads/index.htrw: Added direct links to the ftp site (with
	hardcoded version numbers).  In the future, this should be
	generated automatically, like in the old site.  Added sub-section
	for Linux and UNIX.  Later, we can add some links to binaries.

	* about/index.htrw: Removed the links to the ChangeLogs and splash
	screen gallery, as proposed on the list.  The e-mail addresses
	must be stripped out of the ChangeLogs (or obfuscated) and the
	format of the files will probably change anyway (breaking the
	links).  The splash screen gallery is also likely to be
	re-organized in the near future, with better thumbnails and a
	structure that would be less confusing.

	* programmatic/downloads/mirrorfmt.py (do_file): If a link to a
	mirror site contains a comment (anything after some whitespace),
	the comment must not be included in the link.

	* programmatic/downloads/.cvsignore: Ignore generated file
	mirrors.xhtml.

	* programmatic/downloads/MIRRORS: Updated the list of mirrors
	according to the latest updates that I made on the ftp site.

	* downloads/index.htrw: Use absolute path instead of relative path
	for including /downloads/mirrors.xhtml.

	* Makefile (mirrors): Added new rule for generating and installing
	the file mirrors.xhtml, which has to be installed before we can
	build /downloads/index.html.

2003-09-19  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/admin/news/news-edit.py,
	  programmatic/admin/news/news-edit-action.py,
	  programmatic/admin/news/wgo_news.py: Get the quoting correct
	  for editing a news article which contains html entities.

2003-09-19  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* style/wgo.css: Added clear: left; to h1.

2003-09-19  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/admin/news/news-edit.py,
	  programmatic/admin/news/wgo_news.py: Get the quoting correct
	  for editing a news article which contains html entities.

	* Added version id to news articles in the main (current news)
	  blotter.

2003-09-19 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /includes/wgo-howto-unix-init.xhtml 
	* wgo-howto-unix-fini.xhtml
	* wgo-howto-bugs-init.xhtml
	* wgo-howto-bugs-fini.xhtml: Added the menus to the files to make them work like the others.
	
	* /includes/urls_go-developer.inc: 
	Add developer.gimp.org to the list of important developer links.
	
	* /includes/urls_important.inc: 
	Changed the header a little so it uses Links instead of URLs.
	
	* /includes/wgo-howto-source-init.xhtml, wgo-howto-source-fini.xhtml:
	Added files wich are going to be used for the source howtos for now.
	
	* /source/howtos/stable-cvs-build.htrw, stable-cvs-get.htrw: 
	Now using the new include files.

	* /downloads/install_help.html: Fixed a typo.
	* /develop/index.htrw: Removed the headers for the links in the bottom
	of the page and add them to the includes instead.

2003-09-19  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* style/wgo.css: Fixed some styles left from the div layout.

2003-09-19  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml: Fiddled with width/height tags again.
	Should be working now.

2003-09-19  Branko Collin  <collin@xs4all.nl>

	* about/index.html
	* about/introduction.html: Spelling, naming, links and real lists.
	I commented out A tags for broken links, but left the link text as 
	a reminder.
	
	* resources/palettes
	* resources/palettes/index.html
	* resources/palettes/op2.png
	* resources/palettes/plasma.png
	* resources/palettes/visibone.png
	* resources/palettes/visibone2.png
	* resources/palettes/web.png: Added a Palettes directory in the 
	resources section, including a few palettes and an index file.
	
	* mail_lists.htrw
	* develop/index.htrw
	* links/index.html: Changed the word 'URLs' to 'Links' where it
	was incorrectly used. A URL is a string of the form 
	protocol://address, whereas a link is a text or image or other
	object tied to a URL that can be activated. Probably not very
	important in the grand scheme of things, but it has been bugging
	me for a while.

2003-09-19  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml: Added height="100%" to the content
	table to make the menu reach the bottom.

2003-09-19  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-tutorial-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-tutorial-fini.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml: Use a table instead of a div + CSS
	for the menu and main contents of the pages.  This is basically
	restoring the table that was used before I replaced it with CSS on
	2003-08-31.  This removes the ability to toggle the menu on and
	off (which was useful for the tutorials), but this fixes the
	various bugs that were reported for several browsers.
	Unfortunately, this also means that the text-only browsers such as
	w3m will have navigation problems again, because of the tables.
	Other browsers such as Netscape 4.x are affected as well.

	* programmatic/tools/rewrite_attrs.py (xhtml_parser.handle_pi):
	Added a new method for correctly printing the processing
	instruction at the top of each file.  The <?xml version...?> line
	was missing from all processed files.

	* Makefile (%.html): Re-enabled the combined SSI processing and
	attribute rewriting.  Added a small hack (temporary) for
	mirrors.xhtml.  A better solution should be found later.

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Added NOSPAM to most e-mail addresses.
	Note that many pages contain some addresses as part of the text of
	the page (especially the footers of the tutorials) and the spam
	harvesters are known to grab these as well, so they should be
	removed or changed as soon as possible.

2003-09-18  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* Wrapped each news article in a <p> ... </p>

2003-09-16  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* Makefile: changed chown to chmod

	* install.exclude: Readded /includes/news.inc
	
	* Makefile: backed-out combined SSI preprocessing and attribute
	  rewriting for .htrw files.  Need to redo the installation order so
	  include files are available at build time.  

2003-09-16 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

	* /develop/old-index.bak: Add this as a backup for the getting
	involved content.
	* /develop/index.htrw: Started to do the first work of the content in
	getting involved. The people images are not going to be on www.gimp.org but
	on developer.gimp.org.

2003-09-16  Ville Pätsi  <drc@gimp.org>

	* style/wgo.js

	* includes/wgo-tutorial-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-tutorial-fini.xhtml: Added a menu to the tutorial
	pages.  The menu is hidden by default, but it may be better to
	show it.  This is open for discussion.  The footer of all tutorial
	pages will have to be updated so that we can use the standard link
	bar and copyright notice instead of having different ones
	hardcoded in every tutorial.

2003-09-11  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>
	* install.exclude: Readded /includes/news.inc
	
	* Makefile: backed-out combined SSI preprocessing and attribute

	* admin/index.ssi: renamed admin/index.htrw
	

2003-09-09  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-admin-init.xhtml: The correct spelling of the
	onLoad event handler in XHTML is onload, not onLoad.

2003-09-08  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.css
	* style/wgo.js
	* includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-admin-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml: Yet another attempt at improving
	the cross-browser support.  Now, the margin for the "main" div is
	specified in em instead of pixels and the menu is re-adjusted in
	the onLoad event handler for the body element.

	* admin/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/about/ChangeLogs/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/admin/contest/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/admin/news/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/contest/.cvsignore
	* programmatic/develop/.cvsignore: Automatically regenerated using
	"make cvsignore".  No significant changes to the files, except
	that they are now sorted.

2003-09-07  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* programmatic/admin/news/howto-news.html: Fixed typo New -> News.

	* programmatic/contest/wgo_contest.py:
	  Be smart about thumbnails, generating jpg instead of png.  Yet
	  there are still png thumbnails in the spool, so choose the png
	  if it exists, the jpg otherwise.

	* programmatic/contest/contest.py
	* programmatic/contest/gallery.py
	* programmatic/contest/wgo-contest.cpp
	* programmatic/contest/wgo_contest.py: Changes to use the new
	layout.


	* wgo_queue.py (generate_blotter): print wgo_queue.py revision
	  number into chart source.

	* includes/wgo-admin-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml: Updated for new layout

	* Makefile (%.html): remove the intermediate file in processing
	the attributes and SSI.

	* programmatic/admin/news/wgo_news.py (news.as_news_item): 
	  Changed P to DIV for a news article.

	* Makefile: apply both the attribute rewriter and the SSI
	  preprocessor to files suffixed with .ssi.

2003-09-04  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* bugs/howtos/submit-patch.htrw: fixed url to the CVS HOWTO. When
	chaning a label in gimp-web-urls don't forget to update the files
	using the label.

2003-09-04  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* bugs/howtos/submit-patch.htrw: replaced > by &gt;, suggested
	doing a make clean before generating patch file and added the -r
	argument to the diff command. Updated copyright. Made it valid
	XHTML.

2003-09-03  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* mail_lists.htrw: Removed the gimpwin-dev mailing list.  It has
	been closed since several months.  Fixes bug #121323.

2003-09-01  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-styles.xhtml: Hide the stylesheet from Netscape4.
	The pages look better that way.

	* style/wgo.js: Fixed a typo.

2003-09-01  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml
	* style/wgo.js: Try to make it work correctly, this time...  This
	requires the JavaScript code to be split in two parts: one before
	the contents, and the second part at the end of the page.

2003-09-01  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-xhtml-fini.xhtml
	* style/wgo.js: Include the menu button only if the browser
	supports JavaScript and W3C DOM or IE4 DOM.  The corresponding div
	and image are now inserted by JavaScript.  Re-organized the code a
	bit in order to make it easier to read and to allow pages in which
	the menu is hidden by default.  This could be useful for tutorials
	and howtos.

2003-08-31  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.js (adjust_menu): Improve the layout if the menu is
	taller than the body of the page.

	* source/index.htrw
	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Replaced unix-howtos-* by source-howtos-*

	written.

	* source/howtos/.cvsignore: Stop complaining about the html files!

	* unix/howtos/.cvsignore
	* unix/index.htrw: Removed the links to the HOWTOs that have been
	moved to the /source directory.

2003-08-31  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* style/wgo.css: New style sheet, containing most of what was in
	default.css (only the classes that were used somewhere).

	* style/wgo.js: New file containing some bits of JavaScript for
	adjusting the size of the navigation menu and for toggling the
	visibility of that menu.

	* images/menubutton.png: New image for the corner of the menu.

	* includes/wgo-xhtml-init.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-xhtml-fini.xhtml
	* includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml

	* includes/linkbar.inc
	* includes/menu.inc
	* includes/tutnavbar.inc
	* includes/urls_maillist.inc
	* includes/wgo-menu.xhtml: Deleted these unused files.  Some of
	them are still used by the old files in about/Changelogs/* but
	those files should be deleted and replaced by something else so it
	is not a big problem if they are temporarily broken.

	* docs/index.htrw,
	* tutorials/Smart_Sharpening/warp-sharp.htrw,
	* tutorials/Lite_Quickies/index.htrw,
	* tutorials/Blur_Overlays/index.htrw: <div class="subtitle"> is
	replaced by <h2>.  The class "subtitle" is now gone.

	* develop/gegl.html
	* develop/help.html
	* develop/plugins.html
	* develop/print.html
	* develop/stable.html
	* develop/unstable.html: Deleted these files that were created
	from a template but were never filled with real contents.  They
	will probably be replaced by a script (cron job) that fetches the
	ChangeLogs from CVS and creates the pages automatically.

	* develop/index.html,
	* develop/index.htrw: Renamed and commented out the links to the
	deleted files.

2003-08-29  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml,

	work in these included files.  Replaced wgo:webmasters by the path
	to /webmasters.html.

	cvsrc.

	* unix/howtos/stable-cvs-build.htrw,
	* unix/howtos/stable-cvs-get.htrw: Moved from /unix to /source in
	order to fix bug #119246.  We still need an index page for that
	section before being able to close that bug report.

	* unix/howtos/HACKING: Removed.  It should be replaced by a
	symbolic link to a checked-out CVS gimp tree.  I will deal with
	that later, so the link will be broken for the moment.

2003-08-29  Raphael Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* includes/wgo-admin-fini.xhtml,
	* includes/wgo-page-fini.xhtml: Updated copyright year to 2003,

	the webmasters.

	* admin/gimp-web-urls: Added new link to the new webmasters page,
	to the team page, to the bugs page and a new link for submitting
	bugs related to this web site.  Added the missing trailing slashes
	to many URLs.

	* screenshots/index.htrw
	* windows/*.png: Added two Windows screenshots

2003-08-23  Branko Collin <collin@xs4all.nl>

	em.hellbrokeloose to make them more clear on website. Also add bold to
	make them even more clear. This closes bug: #119479

	the text a bit. Change <A HREF=""></A> to <a href=""></a> that is used
	for XHTML.

    * style/default.css, added pre style (text) to move the text pages away from
                         the margin.  still considering a "notepad" style for the
                         windows section.  i copied the span.filter class into
                         span.path.  we should consider using it named this way, as
                         even the filter is a path.  i hope the designer doesn't get

2003-03-31  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * Fixed a redirection bug in

          which cause the script to fail because of an argument to
          wgo_news.header()

2003-03-22  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * Created admin/gimp-web-urls-subst which is gimp-web-urls
        modified for the new syntax.

        * Added new substitution programme, programmatic/tools/subst.py
        which handles arbitrary text files.  Two potentially significant
        effects of using the new substitution mechanism is the loss of the
        ability to insert a comment declaring the output is automatically
        generated, and run-time is increased due to context free
        substitutions and the flat substitution dictionary.

2003-03-22 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

        * style/old-default.css: This is the old default.css file.

        * /tutorials/Perlotine/*.html: Looked at the validation more.

2003-03-19  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * install.sh (log): Added a timestamp to the install log: make.out

          octothorpe to be truncated and breaking rewrite_attrs.

          installation output to DocumentRoot/install.out

003-03-06  Carol Spears  <carol@gimp.org>

        * style/default.css: moved the font sizes up by 5% for the hn's :)

        * unix/howtos: removed all html and added htrw equivelents.

2003-03-05  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@oak.mysterious.org>

        * Modified programmatic/contest/gallery.py to use the standard
          wgo.py preamble and head.

        * Deleted unix/index.html since it is a generated file.

          Makefile knows how to translate a .htrw file into a .html file.

        * Updated the top-level Makefile with rules for building a .html
          file from a .htrw file

2003-03-04  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@oak.mysterious.org>

        * Modified programmatic/tools/rewrite_attrs.py to insert a warning
          into the output that the output was automatically generated.

        * Switched over the headings for the news blotter to a <h1>

2003-03-04  Carol Spears  <carol@gimp.org>

        * Fiddled some in unix/:
                unix/index.html: created an index-in.html which will generate the
                    index.html using the /admin/gimp-web-url dictionary.  used the
                    new file to generate the old file.  also i changed the <div="*heading" />'s
                    to the logical <hn />.
                unix/howtos/bugzilla-in.html and bugzilla.html added bex how-to to the
                    list.  made it use the /admin/gimp-web-url dictionary for the urls.
                unix/howtos/cvs-stable.html this file has been removed, split up and 
                    replaced with:
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-get.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-get-in.html which i also added.
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-build.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-build-in.html which i added.
                unix/howtos/template.html this file has been removed and replaced with:
                unix/howtos/howto-template.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/howto-template-in.html which i also added.
                style/default.css hopefully was fixed to reflect the addition of the <hn>'s.
                admin/gimp-web-urls is the dictionary for the attribute-rewriter
                unix/howtos/gimpenv added as promised in the build cvs gimp how to

          used outside of forms (which apparently tickles a gecko bug)
          which makes them bounce around.

          new include files for tutorials, and includes my old tweaks to
          make the page purty despite a lack of understanding basic
          design. Caveat!

          new include files for tutorials.

          page layout of the tutorials.

          trying to click a button.  <input> elements are replaced with <a>
          elements of class "faux-button"

        * Contest images are now stored in /var/spool/wgo-contest/current
          instead of /contest/gallery

        decided to have different rc files for the different oses so that
        we have the option to add extra comments to each if necessary.
