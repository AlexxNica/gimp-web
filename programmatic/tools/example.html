<h1>An example for the attribute rewriter.</h1>
<p>
The attribute rewriter changes an xml attribute from one value to
another.  Taking as input a well-formed xml data, and producing the
same data with the appropriate attribute changes.  There are a wide
number of implications as a result of this, but the most practical is
simply the ability to refer to an attribute value by an mnemonic name
rather than an absolute value.
</p>
<p>
As an example, and the initial reason for existing, it is possible to
maintain a set of URL values by a mnemonic name, and maintaining the
real value of the URL in the rewriter database.  A global change to
the URL is accomplished by changing the database, and using the
rewriter to generate the new pages.
