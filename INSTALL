Installation instructions for gimp-web module
---------------------------------------------

Below you will find the options and steps needed to build and test the gimp-web
module for work in HEAD branch.

To be able to build the site you will need a few things installed and running
in a correct way to test the site, the list below tells you the dependencies
needed to test the site.

  1. Apache with SSI support. The site uses SSI to use include files in the
  html files. For SSI instructions go to this website:
  http://scizzo.gimp.org/gnu-linux/howto/apache_ssi.html

  To get a real life example of a httpd.conf file with SSI support you can also
  look at: http://www.gimp.org/admin/howto.html

  2. Python 2.2 or better. The build system uses Python for the main build.

To build the site for the first time you will have to do some thinking about
where to place the build you are doing, this means that you should have a
backup ready. Follow the steps below to get a good example of how the build
system works.

  % mkdir /home/wgo   # Directory where the test site will be

Run the following command with the user root in the root directory of gimp-web.
Username below means the username you will use on the machine.

  % chown -R apache . ; PYTHON=python2.2 ./install.sh /home/wgo ; chown -R
    username .

The site will now be installed and should be available with html files in
/home/wgo directory. To be able to test the things being changed in the
gimp-web module you just reinstall the site after doing the changes. So, first
make the changes in gimp-web and then test them by building the site again
with:

  % chown -R apache . ; PYTHON=python2.2 ./install.sh /home/wgo ; chown -R
    username .

And after doing this test you can commit it to the gimp-web module. Remember to
look in the .cvsignore file to find out what is going to be ignored when
commiting.
