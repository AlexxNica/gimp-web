<h1>GIMP Splash Archive</h1>
<p>
  The splash screens archives shows us some of the history behind GIMP
  and how it has developed through the years. As a gratitude to all
  people doing splash screens for GIMP, this page has been setup to
  show everyone the good art from people contributing.
</p>

<h1>Create your own splash screen</h1>
<p>
  GIMP allows you to make your own splash screen and have that as
  startup splash instead of the one that comes with the archive. To do
  this you can simply follow the guidelines below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make the splash <b>300x200</b> or more. (Smaller splashs will make
      text being cut off)</li>
  <li>Go to your personal GIMP directory.  For UNIX users, this is
    usually in <b>/home/username/.gimp-2.4/</b>.  For Windows, this is
    usually in <b>C:\Documents and Settings\username\.gimp-2.4\</b>
    (you may have to enable the option "Show Hidden Files" in your file
    browser).</li>
  <li>Create a "splashes" directory if it does not exist.</li>
  <li>Save your image in the "splashes" directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Restart GIMP and your splash screen should be the one being used by
  GIMP instead of the one from the archive.  If you have more than one
  splash screen, then GIMP will pick one at random.  More information
  is available in the <a href="/man/gimp.html">gimp manual page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If there are multiple users on your system and you want to make a
  single splash screen available for all of them, then you can save
  your image in <b>$PREFIX/gimp/2.0/images/gimp-splash.png</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Note that older older GIMP versions (2.0.x) used
  <b>gimp_splash.png</b> instead of <b>gimp-splash.png</b> and did not
  look for them in your personal GIMP directory.
