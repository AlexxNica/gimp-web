<h1>Selling GIMP</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>From time to time, we get questions from users who are surprised to
see some individuals or companies selling GIMP from their web site
or as part of an auction.  Sometimes the software is advertised as
being GIMP but in some cases there is no mention of the fact that
what is sold is GIMP, and GIMP is <span class="help"
title="software that may be modified and distributed freely, as long
as you do not deny other users these freedoms">Free Software</span>.
This page tries to answer some of these questions and provides
suggestions for those who would like to sell GIMP.</p>

<h2>Is it legal to sell copies of GIMP?</h2>

<p>Yes.  The terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification of GIMP are clearly listed in the <a
href="wgo:license">GNU General Public License</a>.  Redistribution for
free or for profit is specifically allowed, as long as the license is
included and the source code is made available.  See also <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">Selling Free
Software</a> on the <span class="help" title="Free Software
Foundation">FSF</span> site.</p>

<p>Besides the rights and conditions given by the GPL, it would also
be nice (but not required) to mention in any advertising that the
product being sold is GIMP (or a bundle including GIMP) or is derived
from it.</p>

<h2>Are the developers associated with companies selling GIMP?</h2>

<p>No.  The GIMP developers are not associated with the companies
selling copies of GIMP.  We may be in contact with some of them
from time to time when they contribute some improvements to GIMP.
Some of them have also made <a href="wgo:donating">donations</a> to
the GIMP developers (sponsoring for the GIMP developers' conference).
But none of the developers has direct financial interest in these
companies.</p>

<h2>I bought GIMP without knowing that it was Free Software</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, some companies selling GIMP do not always
mention in their advertising that the software that they are selling
can also be obtained for free.  Sometimes GIMP is combined with
additional software or artwork that adds value to the package, but
sometimes what you get is not much more than what could otherwise be
downloaded for free.  If you have purchased such a copy of GIMP
and you feel cheated, then you should complain to the vendor.</p>

<p>However, if the vendor did not make the complete corresponding
source code for their version of GIMP available to you as required by
the GPL, then the vendor may have violated the license and may be
liable for copyright infringment.  Please try to clarify the situation
with the vendor <i>before</i> reporting any GPL violation to the GIMP
developers.  In any case, you should refrain from making public
statements about the potential GPL violation before you have contacted
the vendor.  Notifying the developers too early of making public
statements about the potential GPL violation may limit the legal
options available to the developers (copyright owners).<p>

<h2>Where can I buy a copy of GIMP?</h2>

<p>We do not sell GIMP from this web site.  However, the
platfom-specific pages contain links to packages provided by several
individuals or companies, and some of them are selling GIMP.
Please have a look at the page related to the platform you are using
(UNIX, Windows or MacOS) and see if you can find anything interesting
there.</p>

<h2>Recommendations for those who sell copies of GIMP</h2>

<p>If you or your company intend to sell GIMP, it would be nice to
follow these guidelines:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Be honest</strong>.  Do not try to hide the fact that the
product that you are selling is or contains GIMP (the GNU Image
Manipulation Program).  Mention it in any advertisement.</li>

<li><strong>Add value</strong>.  Try to provide more than what can be
found in the default GIMP package.  Include a nice installer,
additional plug-ins, some nice artwork, some custom brushes and
textures, your own tutorials and documentation, printed copies of the
documentation, etc.  There are many ways to add value to GIMP and
to make your customers happy.</li>

<li><strong>Respect the GPL</strong>.  The GPL requires you to make
the source code available.  The best solution is to include the source
code on the same medium as the GIMP installation package, but you can
also include a written offer to supply the source code on request.
Note that you cannot simply give a link to the GIMP ftp mirrors: it
should be the exact source code that was used to compile the binary
package that you are selling and you have to cover the costs of
redistribution yourself.  If you sell and distribute the binaries
online, the GPL requires you to make the source code available "from
the same place" so giving a link to the GIMP mirrors is not sufficient
(see also <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#SourceAndBinaryOnDifferentSites">this
section of the GPL FAQ</a>).</li>

<li><strong>Support your users</strong>.  If the version of GIMP
that you are selling is modified in any way, you should inform your
users and try to handle the support requests related to that version.
Providing good support is another way to make your customers
happy.</li>

</ol>

<p>Finally, think about giving something back.  If the software
created by many volunteers helps your business, it would be nice to
return the favor by helping the developers.  You can contribute by
sending some improvements to the code or by sponsoring some events
such as the GIMP developer's conference.  This is not required, but
happy developers are more likely to create a better product that you
can sell later...</p>
