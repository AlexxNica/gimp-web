This directory contains old GIF images that several other sites were
linking directly from their pages.

These images are not used anymore in the new version of the GIMP web
site.  They can be removed at any time.  We have configured the web
server to redirect the requests for the old images to this directory
and we are keeping a copy of these images here temporarily, but it is
likely that they will be removed in the future.

If you are the author of a web page that was using one of these
images, please update your site!

For more information, please read this page:
