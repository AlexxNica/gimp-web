Summary: A page about the new site.



I (Pat David) am creating this page to keep notes and information for building/maintaining the new site.


## A Static Site

Technically, the previous site could be considered "static".
There was some simple templating that was occuring using server side includes (SSI) in Apache.
The previous site infrastructure was fast and worked very well.

*Unless* you consider it in the context of ease-of-use and collaboration.

Working directly on the website required a possible committer to:

* Get a working Apache instance up and running (including SSI)
* Get familiar with GIT
* Be comfortable writing everything in plain HTML.
* Understand how SSI works in Apache.
