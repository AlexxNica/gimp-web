Before you leave for the holidays, we thought you'd like an overview of what we did this year to improve GIMP for you.

Most of the time was spent on improving the GEGL-based version of GIMP (to be released as v2.10) and porting GIMP plugins to GEGL, so that you could benefit from 32bit float precision per color channel as much as possible.

We also successfully participated in Google Summer of Code 2013 and merged more code from GSoC2012 into the main development branch, namely Seamless Clone and Warp Transform tools.

You can find out a lot more in [this detailed report](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-user-list/2013-December/msg00225.html). We wish you to have a great time with your family and friends!
