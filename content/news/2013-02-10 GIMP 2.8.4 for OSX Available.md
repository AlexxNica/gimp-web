GIMP 2.8.4 is now available as [disk image](http://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/osx/) for Mac OSX.

Please note that with this release, we have moved GIMP's per-user data from "~/Library" to "~/Library/Application Support". If you had installed GIMP 2.8.2 before, please open a terminal and enter the following command, so GIMP 2.8.4 will pick up your data from the right location:

mv ~/Library/GIMP ~/Library/Application\ Support
