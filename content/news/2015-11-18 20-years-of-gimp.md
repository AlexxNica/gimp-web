Back in 1995, University of California students, Peter Mattis and Kimball Spencer, were members of the eXperimental Computing Facility, a Berkeley campus organization of undergraduate students enthusiastic about computers and programming. In June of that year, the two hinted at their intentions to write a free graphical image manipulation program as a means of giving back to the Free Software community.. 

On November 21st, 20 years ago today, Peter Mattis [announced the availability][] of the "General Image Manipulation Program" on Usenet (later on, the acronym would be redefined to stand for the "GNU Image Manipulation Program").

<small>Look at the original feature set?  Some sort of self-deprecating joke (bit-depth? color? only took 20 years? 3.0 release sometime before 2035?)

A look back at this page (https://web.archive.org/web/19970711112615/http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp/ )?
