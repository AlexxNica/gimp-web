Unfortunately a rather bad [bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622608) sneaked into GIMP 2.6.9, so here's another release in the stable GIMP 2.6 series to fix this issue. Please have a look at the [NEWS](http://developer.gimp.org/NEWS-2.6) file for a more detailed list of changes.

The source can be downloaded from [ftp.gimp.org](http://gimp.org/downloads/#mirrors). Binary packages for various supported platforms should become available soon; please check the [Downloads](http://gimp.org/downloads/) section.
