We just released GIMP 2.8.10 ! This is a release in the stable GIMP 2.8 series. This release fixes a bug that prevented older GIMP versions from running on OS X Mavericks. We also did some small adjustments to the Save/Export code in order to make things a bit easier. For the complete list of changes please see the [NEWS](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/NEWS?h=gimp-2-8) file.
