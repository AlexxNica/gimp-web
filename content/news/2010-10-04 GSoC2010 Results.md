This year GIMP participated in the annual Google Summer of Code program with three projects. Two out of three projects have been successful: Cage transform tool in GIMP and HDR and matting functions in GEGL.

The new Cage transform tool allows doing shape-preserving deformations of objects. The tool is based on a [research paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20110417075931/http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~lipmanya/GC/gc_techrep.pdf) by Yaron Lipman, David Levin and Daniel Cohen-Or, and was implemented by Michael Mur√©. The tool is implemented on top of a GEGL operation that can be reused to create more transformation tools. For more information please refer to Michael's [blog](http://pellelatarte.fr/en/) or [description](https://web.archive.org/web/20110417075931/http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2010-gimp/wiki/CageTool) of the project's outcome. The code lives in [soc-2010-cage-2](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/log/?h=soc-2010-cage-2) branch.

A project by Danny Robson resulted in a number of new, mostly HDR related features in GEGL: a standalone HDR merge tool, RGBE loading and saving, three tone mapping operators and one matting operator. You can read about them in details on the [project's page](https://web.archive.org/web/20110417075931/http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2010-gimp/wiki/HdrMatting).

The Cage transform tool is likely to be included in version 2.10, and features implemented by Danny Robson will be available in the next release of GEGL.
