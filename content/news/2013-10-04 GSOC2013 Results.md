GSoC2013 program is over now, and 3 out of 4 students successfully completed it.

Carlos Zubieta ported 13 GEGL operations to use GPU via OpenCL, and the gegl-random module used by noise generation operations, then made noise-hsv and noise-cie-lch operations use it. You can read his [report](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2013-September/msg00132.html).

Simon Lui ported the PSD plug-in to use GEGL. GIMP is now capable of loading 16bit and 32bit per color channel PSD files, saving those is a work in progress. The updated plug-in also reads additional data from PSD files (text, slicing information, layer effects), but cannot use it yet: text support needs the relevant API in GIMP, and layer effects and slicing aren't implemented in GIMP yet, so there's nothing to map the information to as of now. His public report is [here](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2013-September/msg00139.html).

Marek Dvorožňák implemented a new N-Point deformation tool that makes it possible to deform objects while preserve shapes consistency. You can watch a [video demonstration](http://youtu.be/OmOyQyuiO_E) of the tool on YouTube. The work is based on a ["As-Rigid-As-Possible Image Registration for Hand-drawn Cartoon Animations"](http://dcgi.felk.cvut.cz/home/sykorad/Sykora09-NPAR.pdf) paper by Daniel Sykora et al.

Finally, Ajay Ramanathan attempted to merge selection tools into a single tool selection with modes (rectangular, ellipse, single row/column, N-side polygon selection modes).

All the source code created by our students is available in respective [Git branches](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp). We will review it and make sure we use the most of it. We thank Carlos, Simon, Marek, and Ajay for working with us over the summer and we are looking forward to working with them in the future!
