[LGM][lgm] is an amazing opportunity for developers, contributors, visual artists, and supporters of free software projects to come together to work, discuss, and learn from each other.
Past years have had multiple days of interesting and insightful presentations, [_birds of a feather_][bof] meetings, and many types of wonderful workshops.
There's also an opportunity to meet some of the GIMP team as well!

This year the host is the [Westminster School of Media Arts and Design][westminster], University of Westminster at their Harrow Campus:

Funds from their Pledgie go towards helping contributors from all around the world converge at the meeting to share and present their work with others. 


### Special Focus: Other Dimensions

For the 2016 edition of LGM, they are looking at a different aspect of Libre Graphics, [*Other Dimensions*][other-dim]:

> For the 2016 edition of LGM we continue speculating and will expand Libre Graphics into Other Dimensions. 
We are looking for presentations and workshops that explore the dimensions of space and material: 3D modelling and animation, Libre architecture, Open Source product design and other fields of digital making and manufacture. 
We are also seeking contributions that offer reflections on the ‘other dimensions’ of open source communities and that engage with FLOSS tools in various contexts including but not limited to teaching, learning, practice and co-production. 
This represents a desire to address the future sustainability of the Libre Graphics movement, through a growth of the core projects and topics that will, we hope, allow us to welcome more and more FLOSS projects and participants to our community.


### A History of GIMP + LGM

Over 10 years ago the annual meetings of GIMP developers branched out to LGM, and we have been attending the event every year since.
It's an opportunity to hold project meetings, talk to fellow contributors to other libre projects, and to get inspired by the work that you, our users, create.

At the 2014 LGM in Leipzig, Germany, members of the GIMP team were cornered for a few moments to capture some portraits.
Here are just _some_ of the faces you might get to see at LGM 2016!

If you'd like an opportunity to show off your work, come check out others awesome results, or are just curious what's new and interesting in the world of free software, graphics, and visual art - then we encourage you to come attend LGM2016.

We'll be excited to meet you in person!
