Summary: This is a first test _Article_ as described by the Pelican site generator.  *Articles* are apparently periodic post objects that are handled differently than static pages.  I imagine that an *Article* should be considered in the place of a *News* item from the current page structure? "Let's test smart double quotes..." Again...



This is the content area of my *Markdown* file.
This should come before the previous file published on 2015-07-29 and called *Article Test #1*.


## Heading Two

Text just under heading two (2).



## Heading Three as well.

This is just after that heading
