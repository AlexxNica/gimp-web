This file is only a placeholder, so we can have an index of current draft articles being written.
This does not currently work on local installs for some reason - this is being investigated.
If you're on testing.gimp.org or www.gimp.org you should see any drafts here.

Files with the metadata attribute *Status* set to *draft* (`Status: draft`) should show here.
