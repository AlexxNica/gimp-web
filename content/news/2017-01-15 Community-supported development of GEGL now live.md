Summary: Almost every new major feature people have been asking us for, be it high bit depth support, or full CMYK support, or layer effects, would be impossible without having a robust, capable image processing core. You can help us fund further development of GEGL now.

Almost every new major feature people have been asking us for, be it high bit depth support, or full CMYK support, or layer effects, would be impossible without having a robust, capable image processing core.

Øyvind Kolås picked up [GEGL](http://gegl.org/) in mid-2000s and has been working on it in his spare time ever since. He is the author of 42% of commits in GEGL and 50% of commits in [babl](http://gegl.org/babl/) (pixel data conversion library). Thanks to his work, we shall be shipping GIMP 2.10 with 16/32-bit per color channel precision and filters that have an on-canvas preview.

But we always need more from both GEGL and babl:

* better performance (always);
* more sophisticated use of GPU;
* full support for arbitrary TRC (think using AdobeRGB instead of switching between sRGB and linear light);
* full support for CMYK and spot colors;
* more GIMP filters available as GEGL operations.

And the list go on.

Which is why we ask you to support Øyvind via his [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/pippin), so that the development of new features requested by you, our community, could go faster.
