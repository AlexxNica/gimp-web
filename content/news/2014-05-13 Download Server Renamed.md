Heads-up if you are still accessing the downloads via ftp.gimp.org:

The downloads server has been renamed to [download.gimp.org](//download.gimp.org/), and it doesn't support FTP anymore. If you have linked any file, installer package, source archive or directory with an ftp://-Link, please change it to http://. The directory structure is unchanged.
