Authors: Wilber Gimp

Yesterday's 2.8.12 release had broken library versioning, so we had to roll out GIMP 2.8.14 today.
The only change is the fixed libtool versioning.
Please do not distribute any binaries of yesterday's broken 2.8.12 release, and get GIMP 2.8.14 using the torrent: [http://download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/gimp-2.8.14.tar.bz2.torrent](//download.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/gimp-2.8.14.tar.bz2.torrent)
