During Libre Graphics Meeting 2015 last week in Toronto our very own Jehan Pagès announced a new open animated movie project, [ZeMarmot](http://film.zemarmot.net/en/). It's a road movie with a marmot as protagonist.

The team will be using just free/libre applications for the production: GIMP, [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), [Ardour](http://ardour.org), and a few others. Jehan will also resume his work on animation features in GIMP, extend OpenRaster file format to support animation, and improve Blender's non-linear video editor as much as he can.
