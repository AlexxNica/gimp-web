Summary: We are releasing GIMP 2.8.20 with various bug fixes.

We are releasing GIMP 2.8.20 with various bug fixesâ€”the most noticeable one being changes to the weird initial user interface language selection on macOS to make it use the user's preferred language.

Also, for users on the Microsoft Windows platforms, an annoying oscillating switching between different input devices has been fixed, this should make using a tablet more reliable.

Check out the full list of [fixed issues since 2.8.18](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/NEWS?h=GIMP_2_8_20).

The source code for GIMP 2.8.20 is available from our [downloads page](/downloads/); pre-built packages for Microsoft Windows and macOS will follow shortly.
