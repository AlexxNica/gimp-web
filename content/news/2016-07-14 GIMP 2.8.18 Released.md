Summary: We are releasing GIMP 2.8.18 to fix a vulnerability in the XCF loading code (CVE-2016-4994).


We are releasing GIMP 2.8.18 to fix a [vulnerability in the XCF loading code](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767873) ([CVE-2016-4994](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4994)). With special XCF files, GIMP can be caused to crash, and possibly be made to execute arbitrar code provided by the attacker.

This release includes [additional bug fixes since 2.8.16](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/plain/NEWS?h=GIMP_2_8_18). An important change has happened to the initial startup experience on Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS platforms - any "GIMP is not responding" errors encountered there should be gone.

The source code for GIMP 2.8.18 is available from our [downloads page](/downloads/); pre-built packages for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS will follow shortly.
