Title: gimpguru.org - R.I.P.

Authors: Wilber Gimp

We noticed that gimpguru.org, once the host of GIMP tutorials (some of which are also present in our [Tutorials section](/tutorials)) has been abandoned by its original owner and is redirecting visitors to some very suspicious downloads - don't go there.

We have removed all links pointing there from the tutorials (please do tell if we missed one), and caution everyone to only consider links on our own [downloads page](/downloads/) and the sites linked from there.

Special announcement for domain owners: if you own a domain with *gimp* in its name and host a forum or something else, and don't feel like you want to continue to do so or renew it some day, please [approach us](/mail_lists.html) - we'd rather take it over ourselves and have it point to www.gimp.org than see it being abused like that.
