Title: Revamping Tutorials

As part of building a new GIMP website we had to sort through all of the legacy pages in order to migrate content properly. A nice side effect of this sorting included addressing [tutorials][tuts] that were out of date (or in some cases, _really_ out of date).  This gave us an opportunity to re-build the tutorials index to focus on (_more_) current content as well as ensure that everything is being licensed in a permissive manner.

[tuts]: //www.gimp.org/tutorials/


## Cool URIs don't change
It [was true in 1998][cool] and is still just as true today. Possibly more so.  Great care was taken to make sure that we didn't break all of the inbound links to the old tutorials during the site update.

[cool]: https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html

This means that if there were any links to the previous tutorials they will still work.  They are still there at the same URL they always always had.  What we _did_ change was the listing of [tutorials on the index page][tuts]:  

<https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/>

That list now includes only more current content that has been permissively licensed for use. If you need a complete list, including the deprecated tutorials, see [the complete list](/tutorials/list-all.html).

An unfortunate side-effect of pruning old material is that we are now a little light on material.
