This site is maintained by a team of volunteers who are constantly trying to improve it. We are all GIMP users and some of us are also GIMP developers. If you have a question or a comment about GIMP, we will do our best to help you. However, we get a _lot_ of mail and we may not be able to answer all queries. The best way to get support is to post your questions and comments to one of the [mailing lists](/mail_lists.html) or [IRC channels](/irc.html), or to the GIMP newsgroup (comp.graphics.apps.gimp).

If you have a problem with GIMP and you think that you have found a bug or if you would like to suggest a new feature, you can also take a look at our [bugs page](/bugs/). Your problem may have been reported or solved already, so please [search and browse](https://bugzilla.gnome.org) for existing reports first.

If you have the feeling that your report will require (longer) discussion - this is true for most feature requests - then you should bring this topic up on the gimp-developer mailing list first.

## Problems on this web site?

If you detected a problem on one of our pages, such as a broken link or some incorrect information, please use Bugzilla to [submit a bug report for this web site](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gimp-web&component=www.gimp.org&op_sys=All). Several GIMP contributors are keeping an eye on the bug database regularly so this is probably the best way to tell us about these problems and to get a timely response. See also [why we are using Bugzilla](/bugs/why_bugzilla.html).

You can also subscribe to the [gimp-web mailing list](/mail_lists.html) and then submit your improvement proposals to the list.

## Download mirrors

You can also use Bugzilla to [notify us](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gimp-web&component=ftp+mirrors&op_sys=All) if a mirror of download.gimp.org is gone or if a new one has recently been added. If you want to set up a new mirror, you may want to use one of the existing rsync mirrors to update your server. Please include the country of your server in the summary of the bug.

Some hints on the server setup:

*   Please try to offer HTTP, FTP and rsync access
*   Check that all README files are present
*   Check that README, MIRRORS and \*.md5 are sent as text/plain

The size of the data as seen on [http://download.gimp.org/pub/](//download.gimp.org/pub/) is currently around 4.1 GiB, with gimp and gtk subdirectories amounting to about 3.4 GiB. New releases are uploaded some time before the announcement is made, so syncing every few days should be sufficient.

## Last resort

If you want to contact us by e-mail, then post to the [gimp-developer mailing list](/mail_lists.html).
