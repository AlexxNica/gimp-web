## Introduction

From time to time, we get questions from users who are surprised to see some individuals or companies selling GIMP from their web site or as part of an auction. Sometimes the software is advertised as being GIMP but in some cases there is no mention of the fact that what is sold is GIMP, and GIMP is <span class="help" title="software that may be modified and distributed freely, as long
as you do not deny other users these freedoms">Free Software</span>. This page tries to answer some of these questions and provides suggestions for those who would like to sell GIMP.

## Is it legal to sell copies of GIMP?

Yes. The terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification of GIMP are clearly listed in the [GNU General Public License](/about/COPYING). Redistribution for free or for profit is specifically allowed, as long as the license is included and the source code is made available. See also [Selling Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html) on the <span class="help" title="Free Software
Foundation">FSF</span> site.

Besides the rights and conditions given by the GPL, it would also be nice (but not required) to mention in any advertising that the product being sold is GIMP (or a bundle including GIMP) or is derived from it.

## Are the developers associated with companies selling GIMP?

No. The GIMP developers are not associated with the companies selling copies of GIMP. We may be in contact with some of them from time to time when they contribute some improvements to GIMP. Some of them have also made [donations](/donating/) to the GIMP developers (sponsoring for the GIMP developers' conference). But none of the developers has direct financial interest in these companies.

## I bought GIMP without knowing that it was Free Software

Unfortunately, some companies selling GIMP do not always mention in their advertising that the software that they are selling can also be obtained for free. Sometimes GIMP is combined with additional software or artwork that adds value to the package, but sometimes what you get is not much more than what could otherwise be downloaded for free. If you have purchased such a copy of GIMP and you feel cheated, then you should complain to the vendor.

However, if the vendor did not make the complete corresponding source code for their version of GIMP available to you as required by the GPL, then the vendor may have violated the license and may be liable for copyright infringment. Please try to clarify the situation with the vendor _before_ reporting any GPL violation to the GIMP developers. In any case, you should refrain from making public statements about the potential GPL violation before you have contacted the vendor. Notifying the developers too early of making public statements about the potential GPL violation may limit the legal options available to the developers (copyright owners).

## Where can I buy a copy of GIMP?

We do not sell GIMP from this web site. However, the platfom-specific pages contain links to packages provided by several individuals or companies, and some of them are selling GIMP. Please have a look at the page related to the platform you are using (UNIX, Windows or MacOS) and see if you can find anything interesting there.

## Recommendations for those who sell copies of GIMP

If you or your company intend to sell GIMP, it would be nice to follow these guidelines:

1.  **Be honest**. Do not try to hide the fact that the product that you are selling is or contains GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program). Mention it in any advertisement.
2.  **Add value**. Try to provide more than what can be found in the default GIMP package. Include a nice installer, additional plug-ins, some nice artwork, some custom brushes and textures, your own tutorials and documentation, printed copies of the documentation, etc. There are many ways to add value to GIMP and to make your customers happy.
3.  **Respect the GPL**. The GPL requires you to make the source code available. The best solution is to include the source code on the same medium as the GIMP installation package, but you can also include a written offer to supply the source code on request. Note that you cannot simply give a link to the GIMP ftp mirrors: it should be the exact source code that was used to compile the binary package that you are selling and you have to cover the costs of redistribution yourself. If you sell and distribute the binaries online, the GPL requires you to make the source code available "from the same place" so giving a link to the GIMP mirrors is not sufficient (see also [this section of the GPL FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#SourceAndBinaryOnDifferentSites)).
4.  **Support your users**. If the version of GIMP that you are selling is modified in any way, you should inform your users and try to handle the support requests related to that version. Providing good support is another way to make your customers happy.

Finally, think about giving something back. If the software created by many volunteers helps your business, it would be nice to return the favor by helping the developers. You can contribute by sending some improvements to the code or by sponsoring some events such as the GIMP developer's conference. This is not required, but happy developers are more likely to create a better product that you can sell later...
