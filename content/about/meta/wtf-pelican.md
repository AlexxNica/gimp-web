## All I Wanted to do...

So I wanted to work on being able to organize the content in a meaningful way.

I had two things in mind,

1. Keep discrete content inside their own folders.
 In particular this is handy for tutorials, where the tutorial files and all of its assets (images, scripts) are all contained in the same folder.
2. Each folder would represent a base url path on its own.  
 This means that for an **About** page, the folder would be `/content/about/`, and the page for it would be `/content/about/index.html`.
