Donating money to the GIMP project is easy! The [GNOME Foundation](http://www.gnome.org/) has graciously agreed to act as fiscal agents for us. Contributions to the GIMP project can be made by donating to the GNOME Foundation and specifying the GIMP project as the recipient. The GNOME Foundation is a tax-exempt, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and all donations are tax-deductible in the USA.

You can choose from several options to support GIMP financially:

[TOC]

Financial help is needed for many different reasons. The annual Libre Graphics Meeting is one things that the money will go to. It helps us to get as many [GIMP Developers](http://wiki.gimp.org/) to the conference as possible.

If applicable, please specify whether you want to remain anonymous. While we usually don't publish the names of donors, this may be considered for exceptional donations.  

Many thanks to all our [sponsors](sponsors.html)!

## Paypal

Donate to gimp@gnome.org, this will notify us, and the GNOME board, that funds have been donated to the GIMP project. Credit card donations are also accepted via this route.

## Flattr

Flattr is a microdonation system. Users are able to pay a small amount every month (minimum 2 euros) and then click Flattr buttons on sites to share the money they paid among those sites, comparable to an Internet tip jar (for more details see Wikipedia's [Flattr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattr) article).
