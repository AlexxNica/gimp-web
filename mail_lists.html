  <p>
  When sending mails to the lists there are some recommendations you should
  follow, at least in The Gimp official lists, but probably are nice
  for all lists to make everyone life easier:
  </p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    <b>The topic is GIMP.</b> Stay on topic. If the discussion goes
    off topic, use direct mail and not the mailing list. Gimp User
    list topics are user problems, techniques, hardware advice
    (tablets, scanners, monitors), request for comments about images
    and usage in general. Gimp Devel list topics are coding, patches,
    bugs and other Gimp's guts things.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use the English language.</b> English is the official
    language of the lists. There is people from all around the globe
    so we use it. If you have problems with English, a small note in
    your message saying so is enough, and never apologise. Listing
    which languages do you speak better will also help. Maybe someone
    can help clarifying the obscure parts of your mail.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Check your facts.</b> Before reporting problems, check
    again.  Make sure you are following the intructions correctly and
    that your version is not old (or that the problem also appears in
    modern versions).  It is very helpful to get a friend to test
    your problem with other computer, maybe you discover what is your
    problem, or can provide info about what cases are free (for
    example bugs that only happen in Alpha computers).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Be aware of your readers.</b>
      <ul><li><b>Do not use HTML formatted email.</b>
          Some people will have problems reading HTML formatted email
          and will ignore you even if they have alternative methods to
          view it (like reading the HTML code or launching a
          browser). Others will flame you (some maybe even have bot
          for that). So to be sure everyone can read it, use plain
          text mail, with monospace font.
        </li>
        <li><b>Avoid sending email attachments.</b> If you must, send only
          useful attachments critical to what you're discussing.  If it is
          more than a few KB (say more than 10), you should/must upload
          somewhere and post the URL instead.
        </li>
        <li><b>Compress attachments.</b> If you must send an
          attachement, use (the best) compression you can find for
          attachments or URLs.  Remember that you can compress .xcf
          files with gzip or bzip2 (.xcf.gz or .xcf.bz2,
          respec.). Those compressors are free and <em>gratis</em> and
          at least gzip should be handled by all Gimp versions known,
          so no excuses. For images you can use PNG (ie. when showing
          bad results and you need the image to be the one you are
          seeing in your monitor) or JPEG (asking how to do something,
          so if the image is a bit damaged due JPEG algorithm, it does
          not matter).
        </li>
        <li><b>Keep lines short.</b> Cut text lines to 70 or so
          chars, so it can be viewed anywhere. If you have a big
          screen, good for you, others do not or just want to use the
          big monitor to have more than one thing on screen at the
          same time. Most mail apps should do it for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use the 7-bit ASCII character set.</b>
          Do not expect people to see other character sets beyond 7 bit ASCII
          and images supported by Gimp. You can hope they will, but do not
          think they will. The same applies to you, if you see text with weird
          characters, maybe your computer has no support for them. Or you do
          not have the loader plug-in for Gimp, if the problem is an error
          with an image. Be permisive about these problems and never force
          them (aka do not send things you are sure most people will be unable
          to see, and make sure your mailer sets the correct MIME type, not a
          general one).
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Quote prior messages only for context.</b>
      When replying to messages, quote the important phrases to give
      context. Use something like &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt; &quot;
      (yep, &quot;&gt;&quot; and space), &quot;]&quot; or any other
      character(s) that seem logical. As most repetitive things, your mail
      app should do it for you. But do not include the full mail again,
      select that part not useful and delete them (yeah, another thing
      computers can do, delete full areas).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Try to be grammatical.</b>
    Do not write all in one big chunk, use blank lines to separate
    things. Also use blank lines to separate your text from quoted
    text. Try to read 100 lines of text in one paragraph, then the same
    text with some blank lines, each 5-10 lines (20-10 paragraphs).
    Some people just ignore the things that they can not read easily.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>NO auto-replies</b>
    No auto replies ("I am on holidays"). They just waste space, and
    people will think they got something when they are only talking to a
    bot. Unsubscribe or set you subscription to no mail mode if you
    need.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Filter your email.</b>
    If you have few time, you can filter the messages. Message headers
    can help a lot to make your life easier, most mail apps can filter
    by headers, or use a helper app for that. The subjects have tags to
    help you identify mail if you sort by hand all incoming mail in one
    mailbox. You can delete the tag and use different mailbox too (use
    other header as filter, like X-BeenThere). Another option is to
    receive the mails in digest mode, all in one mail, so it saves space
    and you can scan the on-going talks quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Include relevant information.</b>
    When posting reports, paste all the interesting info. Use common
    (hehehe) sense to decide what, you do not need to post the size of
    the computer box, but be ready to provide more info in next mails. A
    good start is a small description of the computer (CPU family and
    OS) plus versions of related software (Gimp, libraries, compiler)
    and the steps you followed to find the problem (write your &quot;How
    to crash Gimp in X steps with Y tool&quot; tutorial). If you have
    the solution, even better.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ignore spam.</b>
    If you receive spam, do not reply to it. The list has filters, but
    they are not perfect. The best way to handle garbage is to ignore
    it. In general, you should delete spam, via list or direct, cos the
    best solution is to desintegrate the spammers, and the second best
    to ignore them (guess which one is legal).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No spam, or even a hint of spam allowed.</b> No chain
    letters, no virus alarms, only Gimp. Violating this is
    equivalent to asking to be removed from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Follow those before you.</b>
    If you have doubts about the rules, read the archives. Or subscribe
    and just read it until you see how things are. We do not bite people
    for just reading, but some can get very unfriendly with those that
    ignore the basic rules. We do not ask for ultra complex things and
    etiquette, but things that computers can do for you and a nice
    behaviour on the rest. Most (if not all) of the rules have been in
    use for very long on Internet (they are a tradition, but what is
    more important is that they work).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Conclusion: the faster, easier and cheaper people can see what is
  going in the mails, the better for all. And the topic is Gimp.
