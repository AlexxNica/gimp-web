<!--#include virtual="/includes/wgo-look-feel.xhtml" -->
<!--#include virtual="/includes/wgo-page-init.xhtml" -->

<p>GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.  It is a freely
distributed piece of software for such tasks as photo retouching,
image composition and image authoring.  It works on many operating
systems, in many languages.</p>

<p>This is the official GIMP web site. It contains information about
downloading, installing, using, and enhancing it.  This site also
serves as a distribution point for the latest releases.  We try to
provide as much information about the GIMP community and related
projects as possible.  Hopefully you will find what you need here.
Grab a properly chilled beverage and enjoy.</p>
