<p>
  Donating money to the GIMP project is easy! The 
  <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a> 
  has graciously agreed to act as fiscal agents for us.
  Contributions to the GIMP project can be made by donating to the GNOME
  Foundation and specifying the GIMP project as the recipient. The GNOME
  Foundation is a tax-exempt, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and all
  donations are tax-deductible in the USA.  </p>
<p> 
  There are 3 ways to support GIMP financially. Financial help is needed
  for many different reasons. Our annual GIMP developer conference is one
  things that the money will go to. It helps us to get as many
  <a href="http://developer.gimp.org/">GIMP Developers</a> to the conference as possible.
</p> 
<p>

  Remember that if you want to be anonymous on the list of contributers
  you need to tell this when donating. You can do this as a message in
  paypal, then we will see that you do not want to be mentioned on the
  site.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks to all our <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors</a>!
