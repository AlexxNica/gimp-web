<h1>GIMP 2.6 Release Notes</h1>



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  GIMP 2.6 is an important development milestone that features both
  changes to the user interface addressing some often recieved
  complaints, and a tentative integration of GEGL, the graph based
  image processing library that will eventually bring high bit-depth
  and non-destructive editing to GIMP.
</p>


<h2>User Interface</h2>

<h3>Toolbox Menubar Removed</h3>
<img class="right" src="images/2.6-empty-image-window.png" alt="Empty Image Window screenshot" />
<p>
  The toolbox menubar has been removed and merged with the image
  window menubar. To be able to do this a window called the <i>empty
  image window</i> has been introduced. It hosts the menubar and keeps
  the application instance alive when no imagas are opened. It also
  acts as a drag and drop target. When opening the first image the
  empty image window is transformed into a normal image window, and
  when closing the last image, that image window is transformed into
  the empty image window.
</p>

<h3>Toolbox and Docks are Utility windows</h3>
<p>
  With the empty image window acting as a natural main window the
  default window hints for the Toolbox and Docks has been changed
  to <i>Utility window</i>. This enables window managers to much more
  nicely manage the GIMP windows and do things like omitting the
  Toolbox and Docks from the taskbar and making sure that the Toolbox
  and Docks always are above image windows.
</p>

<h3>Ability to Scroll Beyond Image Border</h3>

<p>
  It is now possible to scroll beyond the image border, making image
  window navigation much less constrained. It is no longer a problem
  to use the edge of a brush on the edge of an image while being
  zoomed it, and one can adapt the canvas to any utility windows
  covering parts of the image window.
</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Renamed Dialogs menu to Windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep a list of recently closed Docks and allow reopening them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make opening images in already running GIMP instances work better on Windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow to enter the image zoom ratio in the status bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for using online help instead of a locally
    installed GIMP Help package.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it possible to lock tabs in docks to prevent accidental
    moving.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>Improved Free Select Tool</h3>
<img class="right" src="images/2.6-new-free-select-tool.png" alt="New Free Select Tool in action" />
<p>
  The freehand select tool has been enhanced to support polygonal
  selections. It also allows mixing free hand segments with polygonal
  segments, editing of existing segments, applying angle-constraints
  to segments, and of course the normal selection tool operations like
  add and subtract. Altoghether this ends up making the Free Select
  Tool a very versatile, powerful and easy-to-use selection tool.
</p>

<h3>Brush Dynamics</h3>
<img class="right" src="images/2.6-brush-dynamics.jpg" alt="Brush Dynamics illustration" />
<p>
  Brush dynamics let you map different brush parameters, commonly at least 
  size and opacity, to one or more of three input dynamics: pressure, 
  velocity and random. Velocity and random are usable with a mouse. The Ink tool, 
  that supported velocity before, has been overhauled and now handles 
  velocity-dependent painting much better.
</p>
<p>
  Brush dynamics have enabled a new feature in stroking paths. There 
  is now a check box under the "paint tool" option, for emulating brush 
  dynamics if you stroke using a paint tool. What this means is that when your 
  stroke is being painted by GIMP, it tells the brush that its pressure and 
  velocity are varying along the length of the stroke. Pressure 
  starts with zero, ramps up to full pressure and then ramps down 
  again to no pressure. Velocity starts from zero and ramps up to full 
  speed by the end of the stroke.
</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added motion constraints to the Move Tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark the center of rectangles while they are moved, and snap the
    center to grid and rulers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable brush scaling for the Smudge tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added ability to save presets in all color tools for color
    adjustments you use frequently.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move handles for rectangle based tools like Crop and Rectangle
    Select to the outside of the rectangle when the rectangle is
    narrow.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Under the Hood</h2>

<h3>GEGL</h3>
<p>
  Important progress towards high bit-depth and non-destructive
  editing in GIMP has been made. Most color operations in GIMP are now
  ported to the powerful graph based image processing
  framework <a href="http://www.gegl.org/">GEGL</a>, meaning that the
  interal processing is being done in 32bit floating point linear
  light RGBA. By default the legacy 8bit code paths are still used,
  but a curious user can turn on the use of GEGL for the color
  operations with <i>Colors / Use GEGL</i>.
</p>
<img class="right" src="images/2.6-experimental-gegl-tool.png" alt="Experimental GEGL tool screenshot" />
<p>
  In addition to porting color operations to GEGL, an
  experimental <i>GEGL Operation</i> tool has been added, found in
  the <i>Tools</i> menu. It enables applying GEGL operations to
  e.g. layers in an image and it gives on-canvas previews of the
  results. The screenshot to the right shows on-canvas preview of
  gaussian blur.
</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ported many widgets to use the 2D graphics
    library <a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">cairo</a> for
    drawing.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Backwards Compatibility</h3>
<p>
  There have been changes to Script-Fu that breaks scripts using
  invalid let-syntax. The reason for the change is to prevent a crash
  of Script-Fu. Please refer
  to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512105">Bug
  512105 â€“ recent Script-Fu changes break lots of scripts</a>.
</p>

<h3>Building</h3>
<p>
  If you build GIMP yourself and don't have GVfs support on your
  target platform, you should pass the <kbd>--without-gvfs</kbd>
  option to configure. Otherwise the URI plug-in will not work
  properly.
</p>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>Utility window</i> hint is currently only known to work good in
    the GNOME desktop environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the Text Tool is currently not an optimal experience. Making
    it work better is a goal for GIMP 2.8.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Planned</h3>
<p>
  For the interested, here are roughly what is planned for GIMP 2.8,
  the next stable release:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Merging Google Summer of Code 2008 projects to trunk, namely
    on-canvas text editing, tagging of GIMP resources and Python
    scripting enhancements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue integration of GEGL.
  </li>
  <li>
    And of course many other improvements...
  </li>
</ul>
