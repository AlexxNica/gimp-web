<h1>GIMP 2.4 Color Management</h1>

<p>Without a proper color managed workflow (pre-2.4 GIMP), harmful adjustments
can be done to images. Without a calibrated screen, one cannot assume to
actually improve the color even though it may appear so.</p>

<h2>Color Managed Workflow</h2>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>Most digital cameras embed a color profile to individual photo files without user interaction. Digital scanners usually come with a color profile, which they also attach to the scanned images.</p>

<p>FIXME: To be able to preview photos with the intended colors, one has to calibrate the display device. And if you're on Linux, you're fscked at this point.</p>
