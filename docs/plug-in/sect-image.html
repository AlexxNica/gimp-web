><P
>Most plug-ins care suprisingly little about these images.
      After all, it's the bunch of pixels on the drawable most of them
      are playing with.  In any case, the most complex data structure
      a plug-in uses for an image is an integer (<code
CLASS="type"

      a simple ID by which the <SPAN

      writing directly to the image (not recommended), and FALSE, TRUE

      to (possibly when using a multi-pass algorithm of some sort, as

      Regions" in gimp.h.</P
