>Whether you knew it or not, lots of blood, sweat, and tears
    have gone into making the modern <SPAN
CLASS="application"

></SPAN
> a <I
CLASS="firstterm"

    doesn't have anything to do with the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Tile of the
    Day"</SPAN
>.  What does it mean?</P
><P
>Well, our graphics are two dimensional, but the memory
    they're stored in is accessed by a one-dimensional index.  The
    usual approach to storing a graphic is to store the whole thing as
    one long array, stringing one row on after another. This works
    fine, until your images get rather large. Say you have a 1000 x
    1000 RGBA layer, that takes 4 MB. Drawing a vertical line down the
    image requires loading the entire thing into active memory, every
    row from top to bottom.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
>'s approach is to break the image up into a series of
    tiles. Now when you draw that vertical line, only the affected
    tiles need be in memory.</P
><P
>What's that mean to the user? Smoother handling of large
    images, hopefully. What's that mean to you, the plug-in developer?
    It's just something to keep in mind if you're at all concerned
    about the speed with which you communicate with <SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
>. If you can
    view the world in a similar fashion, things go much smoother for
    the two of you. Otherwise you'll be running around picking up
    pieces from different tiles&#8230; Also, if it's practical for
    you to work on a single tile at a time instead of the entire
    image, you'll use less memory yourself.</P
><DIV

NAME="sect-tile-cache"
>Tile Cache</A
></H1
><P
>If you're going through the image a row or column at a
      time, you're repeatedly accessing the same tiles over and over
      again. That means <SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
> keeps sending you the tile, you use
      1/64th of the information on it, ask for the next tile over,
      only to want that tile back again when you need the next
      row. This is rather inefficient, and consequently, slow.</P
><P
>One way to solve this problem would be to restructure your
      plug-in so it's not so troublesome in what it requests&#8212;
      we'll talk about that in a moment. But there's another way to
      solve it which is often much easier, from the programmer's
      prospective. And that's to use a tile cache.</P
><P
>This tile cache is separate from <SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
>'s tile cache, and
      is local to the plug-in. The plug-in will store tiles here after
      receiving them from <SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
> (if there is room for them). That way,
      the next time you need data from that tile, it's already handy.</P
><P
>Enabling a tile cache is easy. You have a choice of two
      calls. From gimp.h:</P
><DIV
CLASS="funcsynopsis"
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCDEF"
>void <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_tile_cache_size</code
></CODE
>(gulong <var
CLASS="parameter"
>kilobytes</var
>);</DIV
><DIV
CLASS="funcsynopsis"
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCDEF"
>void <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_tile_cache_ntiles</code
></CODE
>(gulong <var
CLASS="parameter"
>ntiles</var
>);</DIV
><P
>The first sets the cache size in kilobytes, the second
      sets the cache size based on number of tiles&#8230; more or
      less. Here's what gimp_tile_cache_ntiles does
      (libgimp/gimptile.c, v1.0.0):</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;	gimp_tile_cache_size ((ntiles * _gimp_tile_width * _gimp_tile_height * 4) / 1024);
      </PRE
><P
>A couple things with this&#8230; The integer division by
      1024 here may cause it to round down, which probably isn't a
      good thing. Also, the multiplication by four assumes four bytes
      per pixel, which isn't a good assumption if you're not always
      dealing with RGBA images. In short, you may want to do these
      calculations and call gimp_tile_cache_size yourself.</P
><P
>How big a tile cache to make? As many tiles as you'll be
      using at once. If you're going by row, for example, cache
      however many tiles are in one row. If you're both reading from
      tiles and writing to shadow tiles, double the size of the
      cache. You can find out the tile size by calling
      <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_tile_width()</code
> and
      <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_tile_height()</code
>.</P

>The first time I looked at plug-in code, I crept bravely
      in, until I hit a line that looked something like this:

	<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;	  for(pr=gimp_pixel_rgns_register(1,&#38;dest_rgn);pr!=NULL;pr=gimp_pixel_rgns_process(pr))
	</PRE

      at which point I ran away screaming.</P
><P
>After a while, I came back, sat down, and found out it's
      what Quartic refers to as a tile iterator.  Its job is to go
      through the pixel region one tile at a time. You do not have to
      use this method, you may use the
      <code
CLASS="function"
>pixel_rgn_[get|set]_</code
> calls as described
      above. But the reason it's useful is because a tile at a time is
      the most efficient way for <SPAN
CLASS="application"
><acronym
>GIMP</acronym
></SPAN
> to do things, and these two
      functions take care of the messy stuff for you.</P
><P
><code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_pixel_rgns_register</code
>'s first
      parameter tells it how many pixel regions you're going to be
      iterating over, followed by pointers to those pixel
      regions. After some hocus-pocus, it returns a pointer which is
      used by <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_pixel_rgns_process</code
>.</P
><P
>Looking back at that plug-in's code:</P
><DIV
CLASS="example"

><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;	  
  GimpPixelRgn region;
  GimpDrawable *drawable;

  drawable = gimp_drawable_get(drawable_ID);

  gimp_pixel_rgn_init (&#38;region, drawable, 
                       x1, y1, (x2 - x1), (y2 - y1), 
                       TRUE, TRUE);

  for (pr = gimp_pixel_rgns_register (1, &#38;region); 
       pr != NULL; 
       pr = gimp_pixel_rgns_process (pr)) {
          /* Fun Goes On Here */
      }
	</PRE
></DIV
><P
>The upshot of all that
      <code
CLASS="function"
>gimp_pixel_rgns_</code
> magic is, if while in the
      loop, you look back inside your region, you'll find all sorts of
      goodies. region.data now holds the image data for the area
      beginning at <var
CLASS="varname"
>region.x</var
>,
      <var
CLASS="varname"
>region.y</var
>, with a width of
      <var
CLASS="varname"
>region.w</var
> and height
      <var
CLASS="varname"
>region.h</var
>. Here, take a look at the data
      structure (gimp.h):</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;struct _GimpPixelRgn
{
  guchar       *data;          /* pointer to region data */
  GimpDrawable *drawable;      /* pointer to drawable */
  guint         bpp;           /* bytes per pixel */
  guint         rowstride;     /* bytes per pixel row */
  guint         x, y;          /* origin */
  guint         w, h;          /* width and height of region */
  guint         dirty : 1;     /* will this region be dirtied? */
  guint         shadow : 1;    /* will this region use the shadow or normal tiles */
  guint         process_count; /* used internally */
};
      </PRE
><P
>To write to the image using this technique, all you have
      to do is change <var
CLASS="varname"
>region.data</var
>, provided that
      you flagged your region as "dirty" (and hopefully "shadow" as
      well) when you initialized it.</P
