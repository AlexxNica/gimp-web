  Since Gimp is an image manipulation program and not a painting program it doesn't include tools to draw shapes like squares and circles.
  However this doesn't mean you can paint them, in fact there are some interesting options regarding this subject when it comes to the gimp.
  The solution is to use the selection stroking capabilities of the Gimp. This option can be accesed on the image menu (right button click 
  on the image), by going to "Edit-&gt;Stroke".

  Before doing that however we need to make a selection with the shape we want. There are several ways to make a selection, including all 
  the tools in red shown above and select by color as explained on Selecting and removing one color . When using the tools, holding shift 
  at the beggining of the selection process will add the selection to what is already selected, while holding the control key will substract from it.

  for the brush. Brush selection dialog

  Playing around with the spacing options in the brush selection dialog, the color or using one of the animated brushes you can get very 
  interesting results.. here are some examples.
