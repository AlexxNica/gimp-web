<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>
  On this page, the first section of our ever growing (?) collection
  of tutorials, I will demonstrate the basic operation you will need
  to perform over and over again in your life as a computer artist:
  Generate isolated parts of a picture and combine them with a random
  background.  What we want to achieve in this example is to generate
  a 3-dimensional text logo flying (and movable) over the background
  (a simple uni-color layer in our case, but you will easily see that
  you could use any other (stack of) layers/images instead.  Start
  with a plain white picture, black as the foreground color and open
  the layer dialog!
</p>

<h2>Adding text</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-1.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Use the text tool to add some text. You will get a new text layer
  which you can also see if you look at the layers dialog.  You can
  use the move tool to move the text where you like to have it. Then
  merge it with the white layer below by choosing <i>Merge Down</i>
  from the Layer menu. You should now have one layer with black text
  on white background. Using <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; Layer
  -&gt; Colors -&gt; Invert</span> you will achieve something like the
  picture above.
</p>

<h2>Adding colors</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-2.gif" alt="" />
  <img src="tut-basic-3.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  First of all: Blur the image a bit (Gaussian blur at 5 may be a good
  start). Now add a new layer to the image with the help of the layers
  dialog's Ops menu. Choose it to be white. It will be created above
  the just made text layer effectively hiding it.  It will be active
  which can be seen from the fact that it has a blue background in the
  layers dialog. Click some times on the eye symbol to see how you can
  make a layer invisible and make the other layer active by clicking
  on its small preview in the layer dialog. At the end, leave the new
  white layer visible and active.  Use the plasma plugin to make this
  layer a little colorful (Yes, you are invited to experiment with the
  parameters...).  The layer dialog should look something like this
  now:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-1.gif" alt="" />
</p>

<h2>Bumpmapping</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-4.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  It's getting funny now: Use the bumpmap plugin with the blurred text
  layer as a bumpmap on the plasma layer.  You can play with the other
  parameters, but they have sensible defaults.  You'll get an image
  like the one above. Now (still on the plasma layer) choose Add layer
  mask from the layer dialog menu. Choose the mask to be
  white. Nothing will change on the image for now, but the layer
  dialog will look like this:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-2.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  You can toggle whether a layers mask or the actual picture is active
  by clicking on their previews in the layers dialog.
</p>

<h2>Using the layer mask</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-5.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Now activate the text layer again. (you don't have to make the
  layers on top invisible to work on this layer.  It's enough that you
  activate it in the layers dialog.)  Now
  do <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; Edit -&gt; Copy</span>. Make
  sure you have the mask of the top layer selected and the layer is
  activated.  Choose <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; Edit -&gt;
  Paste</span>. You will again get a floating selection, shown in the
  layer dialog like this:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-3.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Use the layer dialog menu to Merge Down the text layer. This will
  combine it with the previously activated layer (which is the mask of
  the plasma layer in our case). This will leave you with the
  following scenario:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-4.gif" alt="" />
</p>

<h2>Adjusting the levels</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-6.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Now add a new layer and fill it with some color (e.g. with the help
  of the bucket fill tool) and use Raise Layer or Lower Layer from the
  layer dialog menu to achieve something like this:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-5.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Now you'll see that the image of the logo isn't very sharp. We'll
  change this now. Make sure you have selected the plasma layer's mask
  and open <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; Layers -&gt; Colors
  -&gt; Levels</span>.  This tool is one of the most important tools
  you have! Play with the little triangles you'll see in the two grey
  gradients and watch their effect on the image.  For now, try to
  achieve something like the following:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-6.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  What we do here is making the border of the mask sharper, and by
  that means, sharpening the whole picture (the area which is neither
  100% opaque nor transparent will become smaller).  But we can easily
  avoid the picture getting pixel-steps by leaving still a smooth
  transition between opaque and transparent parts of the layer.  (If
  you didn't realize it by now - I bet you did - the layer mask works
  in such a way that all black parts of the mask will become
  transparent parts of the layer and all white parts will stay opaque
  (with smooth transitions realized by values of grey).
</p>

<h2>Creating a drop-shadow</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-7.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Using the layer menu you will have noticed the entry Duplicate
  Layer.  Use this now. Then use Apply Layer Mask and Lower Layer
  which should leave you with something like this:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-7.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Make sure you checked Preserve Transparency (Keep Trans.) and then
  use the paint tool to make the copy of the logo black (You don't
  have to be careful: The preserve transparency (Keep Trans.) button
  will let you paint only on opaque parts of the image). This will
  give you:
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="tut-basic-dia-8.gif" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Now make sure you unchecked the button again, blur the layer and
  move it (with the move tool) some pixels to the right and downwards.
  Adjust the transparency with the slider so the background will shine
  through: You've just generated a so-called drop shadow, which
  greatly enhances the 3d effect and is used in very many places.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  That's it! Now have a lot of fun making flying logos!
