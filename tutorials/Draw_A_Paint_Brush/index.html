<div class="subtitle">Intention</div>
<p>
  So, we want to create a nice paintbrush image with the Gimp. This tutorial can be a bit complex and I think it is better for a bit more advanced gimper. 
  If you want to learn the basics, a good way to do so is to get one of the many Gimp books written. If I must pick one to recommend, I think it would be Grokking The Gimp, 
  it is pretty good. But I am sure many of the others are great too, check a few out at your bookstore! 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 1</div>
<p class="images">

</p>
<p>
  Anyway, we start off with a plain gray image. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 2</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="2.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  We first create a new transparent layer, and name it "tip" since we start drawing the brush from the brush tip. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 3</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="3.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Use the Bezier (Paths) tool to make a brush-shaped selection, like on the above image. This could be tricky if you are not used to the tool, 
  so it might be helpful to check out my Bezier tool tutorials if you have trouble. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 4</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="4.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Just fill the selection with black color. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 5</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="5.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Make another bezier selection, now inside the black brush tip. Since a wet brush tip is rather shiny, we want to add a hilight too make it look realistic. 
  Try to think where the light comes from, and make the selection accordingly.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 6</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="6.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  We are going to use the Blend tool (gradient fill) to make the hilight. You might want to make a new layer for the hilight so you can edit it later if you are not happy with the result.
  <br /><br />
  The important thing here is to set the blend mode to "FG to Transparent", we only want to add white, not the black. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 7</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="7.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Make a blend from top to bottom, so that the white fades out towards the brush tip. 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 8</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="8.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Then make another bezier selection that will form the brush metal handle, this is a bit more tricky, try to think where the brush handle will point, 
  and add small "roundings" to the ends. Then fill the selection with a rather mid gray gradient. It does not look very real yet, but we want to bring this to life next...
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 9</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="9.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Keep the selection active still, and start adding black shadows with the airbrush tool so the shape gets some depth and looks more three-dimensional.
  <br /><br />
  This takes a bit of work, start first with large fuzzy brush, and work towards finer detail by using a smaller fuzzy brush. As far as I know, 
  real airbrush artists use the same method to paint, they just use masking film and tape in place of the bezier selection. 
  <br /><br />
  Again, think how the light would reflect and how the shadows would be on a real object. And dont worry if it does not look right at first, it needs some practice and patience.
