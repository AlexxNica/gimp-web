   This tutorial is aimed squarely at the novice GIMP user. The more experienced user may find some techniques here useful. 
   This is the same procedure I used to create the logo on my homepage, albeit with slightly different settings. I'll point
   out the differences as I go along. I've taken a lot of screen shots to support this tutorial, so enjoy :)
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 1</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-00.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Fire up The GIMP and create a new image. I used a white background at 500px by 200px. I feel this size it adequate as my
  website at the time of writing uses 500px tables.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 2</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-01.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Start by laying down some text that is wider than 400px and not too thin. I've used a font called Pricedown. The text should 
  be created as a new layer. If you use GIMP FreeType then it is done for you, otherwise click the New Layer button in the Layers, 
  Channels, &amp; Paths dialog (looks like a blank piece of paper). It will help to change the layer size to that of the image. 
  Do so by accessing the Layers menu (right click or Control+Click on the layer you wish to operate on) and select Layer to Imagesize.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 3</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-02.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Duplicate the text layer (text) twice. One for the highlight effect (highlight) and one for the shaded part of the effect (lowlight). 
  The highlight layer needs to be white, so select that layer, check the Keep Trans. box on the Layers, Channels, &amp; Paths dialog, and fill it with white. 
  You can do this easily by dragging the white color swatch from the toolbox over to the image (assuming that the highlight layer is currently selected). 
  Keep Trans. means "Keep Transparency"; this will ensure that any transformations or fills made to that layer will only affect the non-transparent part of the image.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 4</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-03.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Duplicate the text layer again and move it to the top of the Layers stack (use the little up facing arrow head on the Layers, Channels, &amp; Paths dialog). 
  Make sure that Keep Trans. is un-checked and then blur it. I used Gaussian Blur (RLE) at 10 pixels. When I did the original logo, it was set lower than 
  this to make the effect less rounded.
  <br /><br /> 
  You will need to make sure that the layer boundary is larger than the layer so that the blur can spread nicely. Step 2 mentions this.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 5</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-04.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Duplicate the blurred layer once (tmp1 and tmp2). These layers are used to create the edge lighting for the text.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 6</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-05.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Nudge one of the blurred layers (tmp1) down and to the right about 5 pixels. The precise number of pixels depends on how blurred and thus how round
  the text will appear to be, so use your best judgement. You can nudge layers my using the Move tool and the cursor keys on your keyboard. 
  It doesn't matter which of the blurred layers you use in this step, as long as you know which one you didn't move \x{2013} you'll be needing to do
  a very similar thing to that one soon.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 7</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-06.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Now create a selection using the blurred layer (the one you moved in step 6) using Alpha to Selection. This selection is a precise selection based
  on the layer and includes alpha (transparency) information. Handy stuff. You'll notice that I've turned off the layer below (the other blurred layer). 
  This was done to make sure I could see how far I moved this layer during step 6.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 8</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-07.png" alt=""/>
  <img src="logo-08.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Now that the layer is selected...
  <br /><br />
  Select the highlight layer and...
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 9</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-09.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Cut (edit/cut or CTRL+X on PC or Command+X on Mac). This will remove the blurred layers selection from the highlight layer. You could do this with
  channel masks, but I'm a man of simple needs and wants. There's another step after this that I haven't documented, but that's because it's the same
  thing again (steps 6-10) but with the other layer (tmp2: see steps 5 and 6). Move (nudge) that layer in the opposite direction (up and to the left
  about 5 pixels), then make the cut from the lowlight layer. Once you're done, delete the two blurred layers (tmp1 and tmp2). 
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 10</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-10.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  I like to take quasi-breaks while doing some images, and this is one of those times. A good time to roll a cigarette or grab a cup coffee. I also tend
  to clean up temporary layers occasionally.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 11</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-11.png" alt=""/>
  <img src="logo-12.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Now we'll add the first elements of 3D-ness to the logo. The original text layer is the base layer for any color you want to add. I'll use grey70,
  but you could just as easily use any old color you like. It's a good idea to play with this as you can get some funky plastic logos too. Make sure
  Keep Trans. is checked when you fill the layer.
  <br /><br />
  As you can see in the upper right image, it's starting to look like something now.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Step 12</div>
<p class="images">
  <img src="logo-13.png" alt=""/>
  <img src="logo-14.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  Click the blank piece of paper on the Layers, Channels, &amp;  Paths dialog and make a new transparent layer called outline. Move this new layer down the
  layers stack until it's underneath the original text layer.
</p>
<p>
  Select the original text layer (the one you added some color to) and do the Alpha to Selection trick again. Right click on the image and use Select &gt; grow.
  This will make the new selection larger by a number of pixels - I used a value of 2 pixels. 
  Once you have a selection, be sure to reselect the new layer (outline) so that you can fill it (step 17).
