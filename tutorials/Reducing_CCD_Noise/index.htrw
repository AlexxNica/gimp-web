<h2>Intention</h2>
<p class="images">

</p>
<p>
  Images captured by a CCD or CMOS imaging chip will often have some noise 
  present. This noise typically can be seen as RGB "flecks", 
  especially noticable in the in the shadow areas of an image. The red 
  and blue channels are especially susceptible. 
  Higher ISO settings and higher ambient temperatures increase the 
  likelihood of acquiring this noise along with your image.
</p>
<p>
  If you find it necessary to shoot with a higher ISO and you find that 
  you have an unpleasant amount of noise in your image, this tutorial 
  will help you improve the image.
</p>

<h2>The Procedure</h2>
<p>
  One procedure that works reasonably well is to apply the Despeckle 
  filter. Unfortunately, this filter will soften the image. 
  Fortunately, you can get sharpen the image to partially offset this.
</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="image-original.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="image-original-zoom100.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Here is the original image. Notice how bad the noise is, especially 
  in the shadows of the face and in the white wall (back right).
</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="despeckle.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="image-despeckled-zoom100.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Right-click in the image and select <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; 
  Filters -&gt; Enhance -&gt; Despeckle</span>.
  <br />
  You can play around with the settings, but you'll likely want to keep 
  the radius pretty small. If you raise it too high you'll destroy 
  details like the catchlights in the eye. 
  The "Recursive" option seems to cause a more aggressive filter effect. 
  Try it if you have an especially noisy image.
</p>
<p>
  Examine the resulting image, zooming in to examine shadow areas. 
  You'll notice that the noise is appreciably less objectionable. 
  You cannot really eliminate it, but it is "smoothed out".
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, you may also notice that the image is softer; the 
  despeckle filter actually blurs the image. 
  Fortunately we can offset this to some degree by sharpening.
</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="image-final-zoom100.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  For best results, especially with a noisy image, you'll want to 
  use smart sharpening, explained elsewhere on this site.
  <br />
  This particular image was edge sharpened on all RGB channels. 
  If you find edge ("smart") sharpening too difficult, 
  just apply a little global sharpening to offset the softening.
</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p class="images">
  <img src="image-final.jpg" alt="" />
  <img src="image-original.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
  Zoomed out (upper left). Compare to the original (upper right) 
  Look at the arm and the white wall in back right. Much better.
</p>

<h2>Tips and Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It may not be necessary to apply the despeckle filter across 
  all RGB channels; as I mentioned earlier, CCD noise tends to show 
  up predominantly in the blue or red channels. 
  You can open the Layers dialog (<kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd>), click on the 
  Channels tab and just select the channel(s) that you want to apply 
  the filter to. 
  To examine the individual channels for noise, right click in the 
  image and select 
  <span class="filter">&lt;Image&gt; Image -&gt; Mode -&gt; 
  Decompose</span>; 
  choose RGB for the decomposition.
</li>
<li>
  Similarly, you can try decomposing to HSV or LAB, running the despeckle filter 
  on one or more parts (e.g. value channel from HSV) and recomposing.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Note:</b> along these lines I have seen it suggested from several sources 
  that decomposing to LAB, applying a slight gaussian blur to the A+B channels 
  and then sharpening the L channel is a good approach to reducing CCD 
  artifacts. I have to say that so far in my experiments this approach has not worked for me; 
  I find the despeckle method far superior.
  </li>
</ul>
