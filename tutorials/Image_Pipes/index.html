  Gimp 1.1 and the soon to come 1.2 introduce alot of new features, including the ability to use full color "pixmap brushes". 
  In addition, you can also combine single frame pixmap brushes into a "image pipe". A Gimp Image Pipe allows you to spray out 
  series of full color pixmaps. To make it more flexible, the order the images are painted onto the campus can depend on direction, angle, speed, or other factors.
</p>
<p>
  This effect can be used in many ways, from a simple way to paint repeated images, or as sophisticated texture generation.
  The flexibilty in the way images are sequenced and composited to the canvas on the image can make creating a imae pipe to do what you want 
  seem difficult. However, for almost all common image pipes it is easy to set them up.
</p>

  Taking a set of images and making a image pipe out of them is a common configuration.
  The easiest way to do this is to create each indivual image as a separate layer in an image, much like you would if you were going to save 
  an animated image. And in fact this is often a convient way to think of image pipe creation. As designing an animation of which snapshots 
  are going to be composited to the canvas.
  Lets start with a simple example image, an 8 layer image. In this case, with the numbers 1-8 on each layer. This will help to make it more 
  obvious what the various "ranks" do. 
</p>
<p>
  There isnt currently a loader for gih (the gimp image pipe, so I include the source xcf images here.
  To start creating a image pipe, you will need to save the file in the ".gih" extension. To use the brush immediately, 
  you probabaly want to save it in the brushes/ subdir of your gimp directory (probabaly ~/.gimp-1.1).
  To save the image you will be presented with a save dialog for the GIH plugin. (Image above)
</p>
<p class="images">
  <img src="example_1.jpg" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>
  For a simple image like this, the only values you usually need to change are "Spacing", The "Number of Cells", the number of "Ranks", 
  and the "selection" for each rank. Spacing is pretty much the same as for regular brushes. It indicate what percentage of a brush width 
  or height that the cursor moves between each time the shape is pasted. Ranks indicates how many levels of variation to use by the Selection values. 
  For this image, the value of ranks should be equal to the number of images in the stack. Since it is possible to have multi-dimensional pipes, 
  there needs to be a way to set more than one rank.
</p>
<p>
  For this example, we are going to choose to select from the rank using method "incremental". This essential means that the images will be selected 
  in the order they are in the layer stack.
  <br /><br />
  Other options include:
  <br /><br />
  Random: selects the images in a random order.
  <br /><br />
  Angular: selects the images based on the angle the brush is moving at.
  <br /><br />
  Velocity: selects the images based on the velocity the brush is moving at.
  <br /><br />
  Pressure: selects the images based on the pressure of the brush (requires a pressure sensitive tablet)
  <br /><br />
  xtilt: selects the images based on the xtilt (also requires a tablet)
  <br /><br />
  ytilt: selects the images based on the ytilt (also requires a tablet)
</p>
<p>
  After saving the image, you can "refresh" the brush list and then select the new image. For an example of what this can do, tale a look at the
  example image above (also making use of the fun gradient brushes).
