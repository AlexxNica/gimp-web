  Welcome to The New GIMP Web Site.  This site attempts to help you to
  use The GIMP.  The GIMP (GNU/Image Manipulation Program) is a very nice
  graphics manipulation application that works on many operating systems,
  in many languages, on many file formats and is used for a variety of
  computer imagery purposes.  Hopefully, you will find what you need here.
  Grab a properly chilled beverage and enjoy.
