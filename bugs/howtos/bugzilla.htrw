<h2>or How To Report GIMP Bugs</h2>
<p>
  If you find a bug or think you find a bug, it is very important to report it. 
  If the developers don't know it is broken (or might be broken), they can't 
  fix it. So there you are at your computer trying to do something with GIMP 
  and it freaks out at you. It can be a frightening experience at times. 
</p>

<h3>First, Next, Third</h3>
<p>
  First: Get out a piece of paper or open a text file and scribble down 
  everything you can remember about what you were doing when it happened. Also 
  write down the exact wording of any error messages you received. 
</p>
<p>
  Next: Go away and yell and scream and do whatever you need to do to relax 
  again. Your next step will be to brave Bugzilla, the GNOME bug tracker. It is 
  used to track bug reports and requests for enhancements for GIMP and <span
  class="help" title="the GIMP ToolKit">GTK+</span> (see also <a
  href="/bugs/why_bugzilla.html">why we are using Bugzilla</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Third: Check to see if your bug has been reported yet. Go to the 
  <a href="home:gimp-bugzilla_stable_current">Current Bug List</a> to see if 
  something that looks like your bug has been reported yet. Don't worry if it 
  has, you can still help. See the section: <a href="#enhance">Enhancing Bug Reports</a>. 
  If you can't find something that sounds like your bug there, you will need to 
  report it.
</p>

<h2>Getting Ready to Report and Reporting a Bug</h2>
<p>
  The goal of the following is to give the developers as much information about 
  what goes wrong as possible. This helps them find out what needs to be fixed.
</p>

<h3>The Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
       Use <kbd>gimp --version</kbd> or the about dialog to check your GIMP 
       version. Next check with <a href="home:gimp">www.gimp.org</a> to see 
       what the most recent GIMP release is. If your GIMP is old, update then 
       try to to reproduce the bug. Your bug may have been fixed in the most 
       recent release. If you are running GIMP from CVS, update your CVS and 
       recompile. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
       Attempt to reproduce the problem. Go do what you were doing when it 
       happened and see if you can do it again. 
    </p>
    <p>
       If using GIMP for GNU/Linux, start the program from a terminal with the 
       command <kbd>gimp</kbd>. Sometimes the program will output error messages 
       that can help. This is especially important if GIMP crashes completely 
       without warning. After reproducing the bug, copy the error messages from 
       your terminal into somewhere where you can save them for the bug report. 
       It is better to give too much information than not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
       To narrow down the exact cause of the problem, attempt to reproduce it 
       in other ways. Prepare yourself to explain how to reproduce it in your 
       bug report. If you are running GIMP in another language, try switching 
       your GIMP to English so you can report menu items exactly with the 
       English menu item name. It helps. (Developers generally understand 
       English) If you cannot reproduce the bug, assume it was some weird 
       freak event and don't report it. If it recurs, consult with your 
       appropriate <a href="wgo:mail_lists">user mailing list</a>. Perhaps 
       someone else can find the key to reproducing it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
       Prepare to face the horror. Go to <a href="home:gimp-bugzilla">bugzilla.gnome.org</a>. 
       If you don't have a login yet, follow the directions to create one. The 
       reason to do this and report a bug with your e-mail address is so the 
       developers can contact you if they have any questions. That way if we 
       miss some useful tidbit of debugging information, they can tell you what 
       to do to get it. Log in.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
       Select &quot;Enter a New Bug Report&quot;. From the list of products 
       provided, select GIMP. This opens the actual entry form.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
       Here you have to tell the developers everything about your system, your 
       version of GIMP, and your bug. Just do your best to tell them about it. 
       A crappy bug report is better than no report at all, but if you write 
       down everything you can clearly, you will create a decent bug report.
    </p>
  <ol>
     <li>
        <p>
           Select the &quot;version&quot; that corresponds with the GIMP in which you 
           found the bug. It is the information you got with <kbd>gimp --version</kbd>. 
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
           Select the appropriate &quot;component&quot;. If you don't know what component 
           it is, submit the bug under General. Descriptions of the components 
           are <a href="home:gimp-bugzilla_components">available</a>.
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
           Classify the &quot;severity&quot; of your bug. If the bug causes 
           GIMP  to crash totally or do other really ucky things so you can't 
           use the program at all, classify it as critical. If it completely 
           disables some part of GIMP, classify it as major (for example, keeps 
           you from using a tool). Most bugs are &quot;normal&quot;. If you don't know 
           what severity to use, call it &quot;normal&quot;. Trivial bugs are 
           annoying but don't really keep you from using the program. Cosmetic 
           bugs are things like spelling errors or UI (User Interface, 
           &quot;the look and feel&quot;) issues. If you are requesting a new 
           feature, choose &quot;enhancement&quot;. Don't worry if you choose 
           the wrong severity. The people getting your bug report will adjust 
           it. Don't mark it higher than it really is just to get their 
           attention.
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
           Select your &quot;operating system&quot;. <a href="wgo:windows">WinGIMP</a> and 
           <a href="wgo:unix">GNU/Linux GIMP</a> bugs are not always identical. It would be 
           annoying to get a Linux GIMP developer trying to reproduce a WinGIMP-specific 
           bug. Under &quot;OS Details&quot; (OS, operating system), provide specifics 
           about the version of your operating system. For Linux, provide the distro and 
           version. It is also useful to list the desktop or window manager you are using. 
           Sometimes a problem is caused by an interaction between the two. It won't always 
           be relevant, but it is good to get into the habit of listing it anyway.
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
           Leave &quot;Assigned to:&quot; blank. Bugzilla will do that automatically. Only worry 
           about CC: if you want to send a copy of your bug report to someone else.
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
           For &quot;Summary&quot;, write a brief description of your bug. This summary 
           will help other users see if their bug might be like your bug. Write something 
           that would help you if you were looking for a bug like yours.
        </p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <p>
          &quot;Description&quot; is the hard part. It is the actual bug report. First 
          provide the detailed description of your bug: a brief overview of when it 
          happened and exactly what went wrong (including error messages). Next, 
          describe step-by-step how to reproduce the bug. Use the exact name of menu 
          items. Describe tools, windows, and clicks as precisely as possible. If they 
          can't reproduce the bug, it will be very hard for them to fix it. Last, tell 
          them anything else you can think of that might be relevant. This could include 
          recently installed programs or hardware that might interfere with  GIMP. 
        </p>

<h2><a name="enhance"></a>Enhancing Bug Reports</h2>
<p>
  If someone has already reported a bug like yours, read the bug report 
  carefully. Read through all the additional comments. Make sure every bit of 
  information you know about the bug is in there. If your version is different 
  or you had a slightly different experience with the bug, add a comment 
  providing your information. Check the status of the bug carefully. If it is 
  marked &quot;NEEDINFO&quot;, see if you can provide the information needed. Do not add 
  a &quot;me too&quot; comment unless your comment provides additional information that 
  might be helpful for the developer. 
</p>
<p>
  If you have provided a bug report and later get more information (like a more 
  specific error message or fancy stuff like a trace), add a comment to your 
  original bug with that information. It is especially important to add a 
  comment if you somehow resolve your bug. For example, you update something 
  else on your system and the bug no longer appears. In that case, add a comment 
  describing what you updated from what version to what version that resolved 
  the bug. 
</p>

<h2>The Wait Patiently Part</h2>
<p>
  <cite>Whee!!</cite> You survived! If you managed to get through all this and submit your 
  bug report, be happy. Be proud. You will later get e-mails about your bug. 
  It might include a request for more information. If you get something that 
  says your bug is not a bug, do not be discouraged from reporting in the future.
  Next time it might be. Submitting careful bug reports and providing additional 
  information where possible helps make GIMP better. The day will come where you 
  submit a bug and later get an e-mail that says your bug is &quot;FIXED&quot; 
  or &quot;RESOLVED&quot;. Then you will know that some developer out there found 
  your bug, reproduced it, and fixed it.
