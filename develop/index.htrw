<h2>How You Can Help</h2>

<p>GIMP is <span class="help" title="software that may be modified and
distributed freely, as long as you do not deny other users these
freedoms">Free Software</span> and a part of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>.  In the free software
world, there is generally no distinction between users and
developers. As in a friendly neighbourhood, everybody pitches in to
help their neighbors.  Please consider the time you give in assistance
to others as payment.</p>

<p>Ways in which you can help:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="wgo:dev">program</a> new features,</li>
  <li>report <a href="wgo:bugs">bugs</a> (errors in the program),</li>
  <li>debug existing features,</li>
  <li>add <a href="/docs/">documentation</a>,</li>
  <li>translate GIMP to your own language,</li>
  <li>translate the documentation,</li>
  <li>write <a href="/tutorials/">tutorials</a>,</li>
  <li>participate in the <a href="http://gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com/">UI brainstorm</a>,</li>
  <li>improve this web site,</li>
  <li>make artwork for GIMP used in or with GIMP,</li>
  <li>let people know you used GIMP for your artwork,</li>
  <li>give away copies of GIMP, </li>
  <li>help others to learn to use GIMP, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, anyone can help.</p>

<h2>Development Status</h2>

<p>The team is currently busy working on v2.10. This will be the first release of GIMP featuring a new, advanced image processing engine, high bit depth editing, as well as new and improved transformation and selection tools.</p>

<p>Porting internals of GIMP to GEGL is mostly done, but more plugins have to be ported to GEGL, and GEGL needs to be made faster. If you are willing to help with that, please refer to the <a href="http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Hacking:Porting_filters_to_GEGL" target="_blank">Porting filters to GEGL</a> page to see what you could work on.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of where the project is heading to, which features are planned etc., please visit the <a href="http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap" target="_blank">Roadmap</a> page.</p>

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>

<p>GIMP is not a bug-free application nor is any other application so
reporting the bugs that you will encounter is very important to the
development, it helps the developers to make GIMP more stable and more
bug free.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a developer or a everyday user to report bugs.
It can be hard to report a bug the first time you try it out but don't
just quit the whole bug report if you think it is hard.  Instead, look
at the <a href="wgo:bugs">bugs</a> page you will find some very good
help about this.</p>

<h2>Web Development</h2>

<p>Creating websites that contain useful information is very
important.  It is actually just as important as doing bug reports.  A
website contains a lot of information that is needed for the
development to move on and it also contains information that will help
the public to understand what the application is all about.</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2>

<p>This is the part where people are always needed to help with the
development, and this is also the part that is the hardest to start
with.  Though there are websites and files to give you a good look at
how hacking is being done in GIMP.</p>

<p>The site you should keep updated with and the site that is updated
all the time with new development help guides is located at <a
href="wgo:dev">http://wiki.gimp.org/</a>.  If you have GIMP
installed at the moment then there are some files you should look at
in the source code that might help you a little.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="wgo:dev-install">INSTALL</a><br />
  <i>(Contains most up-to-date information on building GIMP from source code)</i></li>
  <li><a href="wgo:dev-hacking">HACKING</a><br />
  <i>(Contains a lot of information that you need to know if you want to start coding)</i></li>
  <li><a href="wgo:dev-readme">README</a><br />
  <i>(The main README for GIMP which should be read by everyone)</i></li>
  <li><a href="wgo:dev-readme-i18n">README.i18n</a><br />
  <i>(The internationalization README which should be read by translators)</i></li>
</ul>
